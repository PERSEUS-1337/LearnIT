    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature enacted the 24/7 Sobriety program in California to qualify for FAST Act grant funding and NHTSA funding. This program aims to address impaired driving through high-risk offender interventions. Section 23582.5 of the Vehicle Code allows the court to order individuals convicted of DUI offenses to participate in a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of probation or release on bond if the offense occurred within 10 years of a previous DUI conviction. The program aims to address impaired driving among high-risk offenders. A person with a suspended or revoked driving privilege can enroll in a 24/7 Sobriety program to obtain a restricted driving privilege if they committed a violation within 10 years of a previous DUI conviction. Participation in the program is required for a minimum of one year. A person subject to this subdivision must participate in the 24/7 Sobriety program for a minimum of one year, which involves abstaining from alcohol or controlled substances and undergoing breath testing at least twice daily. Program violations result in immediate but modest sanctions, and the methodology must be evidence-based. The 24/7 Sobriety program involves peer-reviewed evaluation, endorsement by a federal agency or respected research organization, participation in other required DUI programs, preference for testing locations close to the violation, cost based on ability to pay, and a maximum program length of 180 days unless there are positive tests or missed appointments. The court may impose a program up to 180 days in length if the defendant tests positive for alcohol or drugs or misses a test. The Office of Traffic Safety must include provisions for the 24/7 Sobriety program in its highway safety plan. The department will collect data on participant demographics, case history, testing information, and fees. Section 1808 of the Vehicle Code is amended to allow public inspection of department records related to vehicle registration, driver's license applications, convictions, and accident reports. Abstracts of accidents where another individual was at fault will not be disclosed. Abstracts of convictions and accident reports will be available for up to ten years for certain violations. The Department of Motor Vehicles allows public inspection of records related to vehicle registration, driver's license applications, convictions, and accident reports. Abstracts of accidents caused by another individual will not be disclosed. Violations can result in suspensions ranging from three to ten years, with exceptions for specific circumstances. Suspensions or revocations that have been judicially set aside or stayed will not be disclosed. The Department of Motor Vehicles will not disclose suspensions or revocations that have been judicially set aside or stayed. Personal information will only be disclosed in compliance with the Driver\u2019s Privacy Protection Act of 1994. Convictions of specific offenses will be disclosed to courts and law enforcement agencies for a period of 10 years for penalty imposition. Consent to use a driver's license number for obtaining motor vehicle records is presumed if the number is provided for insurance or employment purposes. Insurance agents or brokers are authorized to transmit these records and are not liable for their subsequent handling. Prior to transmitting records to insurers without a written agreement, insurance brokers must obtain written agreements ensuring compliance with state and federal laws on fair credit reporting and privacy."
