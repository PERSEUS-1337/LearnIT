    "content": "The federal government has a strong interest in regulating hazardous chemicals security to prevent terrorist attacks since September 11, 2001. Congress focuses on the security of hazardous chemicals in commercial facilities, marine transportation, rail, and highway trucking. Legislation like H.R. 2651 and S. 1052 aim to increase penalties for criminal or terrorist activities related to hazardous chemicals in ports and marine vessels. The 109th Congress is considering legislation such as H.R. 2651 and S. 1052 to increase penalties for criminal or terrorist activities related to hazardous chemicals in ports and marine vessels. This report provides an overview of hazardous chemicals marine transportation in the United States, discussing risks, federal statistics on shipments, relevant maritime security regulations, and policy issues associated with security measures. The report focuses on marine shipments of acutely hazardous chemical cargoes that could pose a catastrophic hazard to the public. It does not cover other maritime security hazards like petroleum products or biological agents. Due to legal limitations, detailed statistics on specific hazardous chemicals or ports are not provided. Hazardous chemical cargoes are potential terrorist targets due to their toxicity and combustibility. Marine shipments of hazardous chemical cargo are potential terrorist targets due to their toxicity and combustibility. They are part of critical infrastructures and pose a serious threat if intentionally released near populated areas. Protecting these shipments is crucial for U.S. homeland security, as they have the potential to impact nearby communities. Although no marine vessel carrying hazardous chemicals has been used in a terrorist attack, intelligence suggests terrorists may have the interest and capability to do so. Major accidents involving marine transportation of hazardous chemicals are rare but have resulted in some of the deadliest industrial accidents in history. Examples include the 1917 explosion of the Mont-Blanc in Halifax and the 1947 Texas City disaster. While improvements in safety have reduced the likelihood of such catastrophic events, incidents involving chemical shipments have still led to evacuations of coastal populations. Incidents involving marine transportation of hazardous chemicals have occurred, such as fires aboard ships carrying toxic chemicals in Somalia, Spain, and Scotland. While no serious casualties resulted, emergency responders were concerned for public safety and conducted evacuations. Terrorists have attempted to release chemicals from land-based facilities, including attacks in foreign war zones like Croatia. These incidents highlight the potential risks associated with chemical transportation and storage near populated areas. In the late 1990s, criminals attempted to release chemicals from facilities in the United States, including a propane storage facility in California and a gas refinery in Texas. Terrorists have targeted marine vessels, with incidents like the attack on the oil tanker Limburg off the Yemeni coast. Concerns have been raised about terrorist groups commandeering hazardous chemical vessels and crashing them into ports, prompting the Department of Homeland Security to focus on the security of chemical infrastructure, including tanker ships. The Homeland Security Council focuses on the security of chemical infrastructure, including tanker ships carrying hazardous cargoes like LNG. Potential terrorist threats include ramming, explosives, insider takeover, hijacking, and external attacks. The risks associated with LNG shipments are real and can never be entirely eliminated. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) directs federal homeland security activities to focus on terrorist attacks involving hazardous chemical cargo on commercial marine vessels that could pose catastrophic hazards to the public. Federal standards from the Department of Transportation, Coast Guard, and Environmental Protection Agency regulate the transportation of hazardous materials to mitigate these risks. The DOT regulates transportation of hazardous materials under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975, empowering the Secretary of Transportation to designate materials that pose risks. Hazardous materials are classified in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 172.101, including toxic, radioactive, corrosive, explosive, and flammable materials. The DOT groups materials by type of hazard but not by relative degree of hazard, providing a ranking of relative hazard by general class in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.2a. Shippers of highly hazardous cargo must develop security plans, including radioactive materials and over 55 pounds of explosives. The DOT defines highly hazardous cargo to include radioactive material, explosives, poisonous inhalation materials, bulk hazardous liquids or gases, bulk hazardous solids, packaged hazardous material, CDC regulated agents, and materials requiring placarding. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels, identifying hazardous cargo under various regulations. The Coast Guard enforces federal hazardous material laws for marine vessels, identifying hazardous cargo under various regulations, including special requirements for vessels carrying certain hazardous materials such as bulk solid, liquid, liquified gas, or compressed gas hazardous materials. Additionally, hazardous marine cargoes are identified through regulation of waterfront facilities handling these materials. The EPA regulates stationary facilities handling hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act, requiring them to file risk management plans summarizing potential threats from large releases. The plans must include off-site consequence analysis for worst-case accidents and measures to prevent and mitigate damage. The Clean Air Act defines hazardous substances and directs the EPA to designate chemicals posing the greatest risks based on health effects, likelihood of releases, and human exposure. EPA has listed 77 acutely hazardous substances. The EPA regulates facilities handling hazardous substances under the Clean Air Act, requiring risk management plans for large releases. The list of hazardous substances includes 77 acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, and volatile flammable liquids. High explosive substances were removed from the list in 1998. The EPA list identifies chemicals with the greatest potential consequences to the general public. The EPA list identifies hazardous substances with the greatest potential consequences to the public, including acutely toxic substances, flammable gases, and volatile flammable liquids. The report uses EPA/RMP chemicals for marine cargo hazard analysis, which align with DOT and Coast Guard hazardous materials lists. Excluding explosives and radioactive materials, the EPA/RMP list covers the majority of hazardous marine cargo. The EPA/RMP chemicals are broadly classified as acutely toxic or flammable. Specific chemicals like Ammonia and Methane have varying degrees of toxicity and flammability. Ammonia is acutely toxic and potentially explosive, while Methane is not inherently toxic but can cause asphyxiation in high vapor concentrations. Methane is not inherently toxic but can cause asphyxiation in high vapor concentrations and is extremely flammable. Methyloxirane is a toxic liquid and a fire hazard, irritating the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. Uncontrolled releases of chemicals on the EPA/RMP list can have varying effects on exposed populations. The EPA considers all RMP chemicals above threshold quantities hazardous, warranting special regulatory treatment. Chemical properties may affect health hazards differently over water. Some chemicals dissolve or sink in water, reducing public hazard in a marine incident. Others evaporate quickly or create larger hazard zones in a marine release compared to land releases. The EPA/RMP chemicals may pose different hazards in marine releases compared to land releases due to their properties. Further research is needed to understand the relative marine hazards of specific chemicals. The Army Corps of Engineers maintains statistics on marine commerce in U.S. waters, with over 48 million tons of EPA/RMP chemicals passing through in 2003. These chemicals accounted for 2% of total U.S. waterborne cargo tonnage. In 2003, over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waters, accounting for 2% of total waterborne cargo tonnage. The hazardous materials on the EPA/RMP list are included due to their chemical properties making them hazardous to human health. The overall volume of a hazardous material in a marine shipment is crucial in evaluating potential public impacts of a terrorist attack. Over 100,000 marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo passed through U.S. waterways in 2003, with the average shipment volume generally exceeding the EPA/RMP 20,000 pound threshold. The EPA regulations specify minimum threshold quantities for risk planning between 500 and 20,000 pounds for the hazardous chemicals. The data in Figure 1 show the total number of shipments and average cargo tons per shipment in 2003, plotted on a logarithmic scale for clarity. The average shipment volume for hazardous chemicals in Figure 1 exceeds the EPA/RMP 20,000 pound threshold, requiring an off-site risk management plan. Different types of marine vessels transport hazardous cargo, with tankers being the most common in 2003. Cargo vessel characteristics play a crucial role in determining their vulnerability to accidents or attacks. In 2003, over 67% of EPA/RMP hazardous marine cargo was shipped in tankers or liquid chemical barges. Liquefied gas tankers are designed to carry various liquefied gas cargoes like butane, propane, LNG, and others. These tankers have separate tanks that are pressurized, refrigerated, and insulated to meet cargo needs. International shipping codes set strict standards for their construction and operation. Liquefied gas tankers are designed with robust cargo tanks that can withstand high pressures or low temperatures. They are double-hulled for added structural integrity, making them highly resistant to grounding and collision damage. LNG tankers carry only LNG, while other liquefied gas tankers may carry a combination of different cargoes, creating unique multi-chemical hazards. Liquefied gas carriers vary in capacity, with LNG tankers ranging from 25,000 m3 to 147,000 m3. New constructions are planned for ships with capacities of 200,000 m3, equivalent to approximately 82,000 tons of LNG. Chemical parcel tankers can carry 10 to 60 separate cargo tanks for various liquid and chemical cargoes, with total capacities ranging from 3,000 to 50,000 tons. Chemical parcel tankers have cargo tanks lined with stainless steel or specialized coatings to ensure compatibility with chemicals. They also have double bottoms to prevent contact between incompatible cargoes. Liquid chemical barges are shallow draft vessels designed to carry bulk liquid chemicals in coastal regions and inland waterways. Liquid chemical barges are similar to parcel tankers, carrying bulk liquid chemicals primarily in coastal regions and through inland waterways. These barges range in size from 700 to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity and may be double-hulled and self-propelled for transporting hazardous chemicals. Inland barges, which are unpowered and rely on tugboats for movement, travel in groups of two to eight per towboat, with some linehaul tows consisting of more than 20 barges. These barges may be refrigerated and have pressurized cargo tanks available for different types of liquid cargoes. Liquid chemical barges are similar to parcel tankers, carrying bulk liquid chemicals primarily in coastal regions and through inland waterways. These barges range in size from 700 to 3,500 tons of total cargo capacity and may be double-hulled and self-propelled for transporting hazardous chemicals. Pressurized cargo tanks are available for different types of liquid cargoes. Hazardous chemicals may be transported on conventional container ships in various ways, including multi-modal tank containers, drums, portable tanks, or other cargo consignments. Large quantities of hazardous chemicals can be present in container ships at any time, with designated cargo areas for shipping. Additionally, hazardous chemicals may also be shipped aboard general cargo ships, container barges, and ferries. Hazardous chemicals can be shipped on various vessels, including container ships, general cargo ships, container barges, ferries, and other vessels. The volume of hazardous chemicals on marine vessels is compared to other modes of transportation and land storage facilities. Rail tank cars and highway tanker trucks are also used to transport hazardous chemicals, with varying cargo capacities. Highway tanker trucks carry EPA/RMP hazardous cargoes like anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, and LPG. Tank cars, highway tanker trucks, and marine vessels transport hazardous cargoes like anhydrous ammonia, chlorine, and LPG. Table 2 summarizes cargo tank capacities for these transport modes, showing that marine vessels generally have larger capacities than rail or highway tanker trucks. Comparing actual volumes shipped across these modes is challenging due to partial cargoes and multiple tank cars or barges involved. Based on marine shipment volumes and tank capacities, it is observed that many marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous material are larger than individual land shipments. The EPA database tracks on-site chemical storage volumes for facilities required to file risk management plans. Comparisons were made between marine shipping volumes and land storage volumes for nine EPA/RMP chemicals. The comparison between marine shipment volumes and land storage volumes for nine EPA/RMP chemicals shows that higher volume chemicals are generally shipped in larger vessels. Marine shipments of hazardous chemicals either originate or terminate in U.S. ports, with port facilities sometimes serving as transportation hubs for temporary storage. Port facilities in the United States serve as transportation hubs for hazardous cargo, including chemicals used in industrial processes. The volume and type of EPA/RMP hazardous marine shipments vary across ports, with some ports having more transportation and industrial facilities than others. Security hazards may be related to the concentration of hazardous cargo moving through a port. In 2003, EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals were shipped through 113 out of over 360 commercial ports in the United States. In 2003, EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals were shipped through 113 ports in the United States, with the top 30 handling 95% of the cargo tonnage. The remaining 83 ports also pose security concerns. The top 30 ports are located in 15 states. The top 30 hazardous chemical ports in the United States are located in 15 states, with over half in the Gulf of Mexico. The most frequently shipped hazardous cargoes are LPG and ammonia. The ports are classified as coastal, except for one on the Ohio River. No Great Lakes ports are on the list. The data is based on estimates of EPA/RMP hazardous cargo volumes. The list of top 30 hazardous material ports in the United States is derived from EPA/RMP estimates. Factors affecting terrorism risk in U.S. ports include hazardous cargo shipments, non-chemical cargo hazards, passenger traffic, proximity to populations, port configuration, and threat intelligence. DHS considers these factors in its Port Security Grant Program, which identifies eligible ports for security enhancement grants. Coast Guard leads U.S. maritime promotion efforts. The Coast Guard oversees port security and safety, especially for hazardous cargo ships. Compliance with safety regulations can help mitigate damage from terrorist attacks. Since 9/11, the Coast Guard has expanded maritime security regulations to distinguish between safety and security measures. Area maritime security committees assess port vulnerabilities and create plans to prevent terrorist attacks, including deploying federal, state, and local resources. Vulnerability assessments focus on vessels and facilities under Coast Guard jurisdiction, as well as other vital port infrastructure. The Coast Guard has used vulnerability assessments to enhance security of key marine assets and develop new maritime security standards under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. They have also played a leading role in creating the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) to establish standards for safe and secure operation of ships and ports worldwide. The ISPS Code requires security plans for ships and certain port facilities, with designated security officers to ensure implementation of security measures under different threat levels. The Coast Guard enforces security measures under three threat levels, requiring designated security officers, deployment of security equipment, monitoring access, and ensuring security communications. By July 1, 2004, over 9,000 vessel security plans were reviewed and approved. The Coast Guard also conducted on-site inspections of vessels to ensure plan implementation. Additionally, security assessments were completed for the nation's strategic ports. Specific measures are taken to prevent terrorist attacks on hazardous chemicals vessels. The Coast Guard evaluates the vulnerability of marine tankers and inland barges carrying hazardous chemicals to different types of attacks. They require vessels to report information before arrival or departure to assess security risks. Security measures include boarding vessels, posting armed sea-marshals, and escorting ships carrying hazardous cargo in harbor transit. The Coast Guard enforces security measures for ships carrying hazardous cargo during harbor transit and while moored at waterfront terminals. Vessels may be required to have roving patrols on deck. Non-commercial traffic may be banned in high threat levels or sensitive areas. The Coast Guard aims to improve maritime domain awareness and vessels calling at U.S. ports must have AIS transponders. The Coast Guard is enhancing security measures for vessels carrying hazardous cargo in harbors. They are installing AIS receivers at all U.S. ports and developing Joint Harbor Operations Centers to monitor vessel traffic. The Waterways Watch program involves the public in reporting suspicious activity. Additionally, the Coast Guard is working on secure credentials for merchant mariners and landside workers. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) maintains hazardous material emergency response capabilities, including the CAMEO program for first responders. NOAA has linked its air dispersion models to improve support for emergency planners and first responders, partnering with the Coast Guard in 2002. NOAA partners with the Coast Guard and Office of Naval Intelligence for risk assessments on hazardous chemicals at U.S. ports. They coordinate federal chemicals emergency response through the Interagency Modeling and Atmospheric Assessment Center. Industry groups, like the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee, also promote security for hazardous marine cargo. The Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) focuses on marine transportation of hazardous materials, including chemical manufacturing, vessel design, occupational safety, and environmental protection. CTAC formed a Subcommittee on Hazardous Cargo Transportation Security to assess vulnerability and promote industry security awareness. Industry groups like the American Waterways Operators and the Chemical Distribution Institute also play roles in ensuring the security of hazardous cargo. Securing hazardous chemicals against terrorist attack is a priority in U.S. homeland security policy, especially for ships carrying hazardous cargo. Despite new maritime security measures since 9/11, policy issues related to hazardous marine cargo, such as risk uncertainty, resource availability, and security effectiveness, may require further Congressional attention. Terrorism risk factors, including threat, vulnerability, and consequence, remain uncertain for hazardous marine cargo, with debates on potential threats by terrorists targeting ships in U.S. waters. The debate over the threat of terrorists targeting ships in U.S. waters has been ongoing since 9/11. Some experts believe public concern about specific threats to hazardous chemical shipping is overstated, while others argue that terrorists have the desire and capability to attack such shipping. The uncertainty of threat intelligence and the shifting goals of attackers make it difficult to assess the probability of a terrorist attack. The Coast Guard has approved security assessments and plans for thousands of vessels, but vulnerability and consequence analysis of marine chemical hazards still face uncertainties. NOAA and the Coast Guard collaborate on security assessments and plans for vessels under MTSA and ISPS codes. Analysts highlight gaps in understanding the vulnerabilities and consequences of terrorist attacks on hazardous marine cargo vessels. Public controversy surrounds conflicting studies on LNG shipping risks. Limited public information on physical vulnerabilities of vessels to terrorist attacks exists. Research on intentional release of hazardous chemicals in marine settings is lacking. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations in current maritime security strategies for hazardous chemicals carriers, emphasizing the need for a better understanding of vulnerability and consequences of intentional attacks. It suggests that reducing risk uncertainty through improved intelligence sharing and research on vessel vulnerabilities and chemical attack consequences could enhance maritime security activities. The use of standard models and methodologies, such as those maintained by NOAA and EPA, is recommended for analyzing and addressing security risks. The curr_chunk discusses the federal role in analyzing security risks for hazardous marine cargo, highlighting concerns about resource allocation and potential impacts on Coast Guard missions. The use of standard models and methodologies, like those maintained by NOAA and EPA, is recommended for ensuring methodological consistency in security analysis. The Coast Guard's security activities significantly increased after 9/11, with a focus on port, waterway, and coastal security. President Bush requested $8.1 billion for the Coast Guard in FY2006, including $2.2 billion for security. Additional funding was sought for new response boats, surveillance systems, and aircraft surveillance. State and local agencies also sought funding for hazardous marine cargo security. The funding concerns for hazardous marine cargo security, particularly for LNG tankers, are highlighted. State and local agencies are seeking more funding to offset the costs, with federal officials recommending that new LNG terminal operators pay for additional maritime security. However, ambiguity in accounting for security costs and reliance on uncertain federal funding sources continue to raise concerns among government officials. Some LNG companies are resistant to paying more for public security, citing their existing tax contributions. Some LNG companies resist paying more for public security, citing existing tax contributions. New security technology and threat intelligence may lower hazardous marine cargo security costs in the future. The effectiveness of Coast Guard security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping is still questioned. The effectiveness of Coast Guard security measures for hazardous chemicals shipping is still questioned, with concerns about the deployment of security resources and the evaluation of security activities. The lack of performance measures hinders the assessment of progress in enhancing maritime security, particularly in addressing terrorism risks within and across ports. The Coast Guard's internal maritime security plan is mentioned as a key aspect in addressing these concerns. The Coast Guard's security measures for hazardous chemical vessels are questioned due to uncertainties in terrorism risks and resource allocation. There are concerns about varying levels of protection for similar chemical shipments at different ports, leading to potential security gaps. Congress may need to assess the effectiveness of the agency's security activities for hazardous marine cargoes. The oversight of the Coast Guard's security activities includes assessing the effectiveness of hazardous marine cargo activities in the context of maritime security responsibilities. Concerns about emergency response to marine chemical attacks involve potential casualties overwhelming emergency agencies and medical facilities. Specialized medical treatment and salvage operations for vessels damaged in chemical attacks pose additional challenges. The terrorism risk associated with hazardous cargo may warrant prudent measures. Due to the chemical hazard and limitations among U.S. marine salvage companies, emergency response plans for chemical cargoes near waterways are crucial. Funding from the DOT's Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness Fund and DHS's Homeland Security Grant Program can support these efforts. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides a legislative model for coastal LNG terminals and tankers. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals are comparable in volume to those stored at chemical plants. Marine shipments of EPA/RMP hazardous chemicals are comparable in volume to quantities stored at large chemical plants and are often larger than shipments in rail or highway tankers. These vessels pass near populated areas and major U.S. ports, making them potential terrorist targets. The Coast Guard has authority over the security of hazardous marine shipping, and efforts are being made to improve maritime security. Congressional policy makers may question terrorism risk uncertainty and evaluate efforts by federal agencies and the private sector in managing that risk. Congress may raise questions concerning terrorism risk uncertainty and evaluate efforts by federal agencies and the private sector in managing that risk, as well as assessing the resources and security measures in place to secure hazardous chemical cargo. Evaluating emergency response capabilities of coastal communities exposed to chemical shipping hazards is also of interest. Congress may also assess how U.S. hazardous chemicals marine security fits into the nation's overall strategy to protect the public from hazardous chemicals and cargo. Balancing resources across marine transportation and other sectors is a policy challenge. Balancing the nation's chemical security resources across different sectors poses a policy challenge due to varying homeland security authorities and regulations. Limited vulnerability and consequence information, especially for marine transportation, complicates the comparison of terrorism risks across sectors. Without a comprehensive perspective on hazardous chemical risks, security analysts may struggle to identify which chemical assets to protect with limited resources. Diverting resources from safety to enhance security in marine transportation may reduce terror risk but increase overall risk if safety programs become less effective. Reviewing security priorities and activities to achieve common goals could be an oversight challenge for Congress. The Army Corps of Engineers collects detailed marine commerce statistics through its Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center for planning and managing projects. Separate databases track domestic and foreign vessel trips and tonnages by commodity. Vessel types include dry cargo ships, tankers, barges, fishing vessels, towboats, tugboats, crew boats, and supply boats. Vessel operators must report domestic waterborne commercial movements to the ACE. The ACE waterborne commerce databases provide estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics, but with limitations. The databases use standardized commodity codes that may not always correspond to individual hazardous chemicals. The values reported should be viewed strictly as estimates. The ACE waterborne commerce databases provide estimates of EPA/RMP cargo statistics, using standardized commodity codes that may not always correspond to individual hazardous chemicals. Inconsistencies in classification have been identified and corrected to the extent possible. For example, LNG and LPG were initially classified under the same code but were separated using trade data. Shipment estimates for EPA/RMP chemicals may include volumes of other chemicals not on the list, or shipments of one chemical may be included in totals for a similar chemical. Cargo vessels may load or unload partial cargoes at multiple locations during a single shipment, with ACE data reporting movements at each point but unable to provide total tonnage. The ACE waterborne commerce databases contain millions of records with potential data quality errors. Despite rigorous internal review processes, inconsistencies in estimates have been identified and corrected. However, there is a possibility of additional unnoticed data quality-related errors. The databases provide summary estimates of chemicals shipping data without associating it with specific vessels or companies. Individual shipment, vessel, or operator data is not included. The ACE waterborne commerce databases contain summary estimates of chemical shipping data without specific vessel or company associations. Individual shipment, vessel, or operator data is considered privileged information and not for public release."
