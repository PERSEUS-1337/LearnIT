Since September 11, 2001, around 30,000 veterans have been discharged from the Armed Forces due to personality or adjustment disorders. These veterans are often denied access to disability compensation and struggle to find employment due to the stigma attached to their discharge. The Department of Defense's compliance in these separations was as low as 40% between 2001 and 2007. A Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is proposed to review these separations. The establishment of a Mental Health Discharge Board of Review is necessary to review veterans separated on the basis of personality or adjustment disorders between 2001 and 2007, ensuring access to disability benefits and employment opportunities. The Department of Defense will review military separations based on a mental condition that does not qualify as a disability. The Department of Defense will establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within each military department to review separations based on mental conditions not amounting to disability. Each board will consist of at least five members, including a licensed psychologist and psychiatrist. The Health Discharge Board of Review is established for members and former members of the armed forces separated due to mental conditions not amounting to disability since September 11, 2001. The Secretary of Defense must ensure that covered individuals are notified of their right to a review by the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review. The military department responsible for the individual's separation must provide the necessary notification. The Secretary of Defense must ensure covered individuals are notified of their right to a review by the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review. If notification is not received, the individual or their representative can request a review. The notification must include information on obtaining legal counsel and a list of organizations that may provide counsel at no cost. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review will review the findings of the psychologist or psychiatrist for each covered individual. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review reviews the findings of the psychologist or psychiatrist, decisions of the separation authority, and compliance with separation processes. They consider evidence from Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs records, as well as private mental health records submitted by the individual. If necessary, the Board can initiate a review on its own. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review notifies the individual or their representative before conducting a review. After completing the review, they provide a statement of reasons and allow for a motion for reconsideration with new evidence. The Board may recommend actions to the military department based on their findings. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review can recommend various actions for a covered individual, including recharacterizing their separation to retirement for disability, issuing a new disability rating, or other separation options. Compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act transparency requirement is necessary if retirement for disability is not recommended. The Mental Health Discharge Board of Review can recommend actions for a covered individual, including recharacterizing their separation to retirement for disability. The Secretary of the military department will correct the individual's military records based on the Board's recommendation, effective as of the separation date. If a covered individual received a lump-sum payment at separation, their future benefits will be adjusted accordingly. The Secretary of the military department will adjust future benefits for covered individuals who received lump-sum payments at separation, as recommended by the Mental Health Discharge Board of Review. Regulations will be followed for the review process, with specified deadlines for completion. The Secretary of Defense will establish Mental Health Discharge Boards of Review within 90 days of the Act's enactment to review separations based on mental condition. Regulations for the review process will be prescribed."
