The \"Capitalizing Workforce Development Act of 2012\" includes a Job Training Resources Grant Program under Section 403(a) of the Social Security Act. This program provides grants for the purchase, renovation, construction, or lease of real property for qualified self-sustaining job programs that offer job training and placement services to individuals with employment challenges. The paragraph describes the priority given to eligible applicants with successful experience in establishing self-sustaining job programs or those with local organizations awarded grants under a specific section. Nothing prohibits applicants from participating in other federal programs. The paragraph outlines the eligibility criteria for applicants seeking grants under section 413(h)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code. Eligible applicants include national organizations, States or political subdivisions, and Indian tribes or tribal organizations. Grants are contingent on job placement performance goals established by the Secretary in collaboration with the grantee. The Secretary, in coordination with the grantee, must establish job placement performance goals for qualified self-sustaining job programs receiving grant funds. Performance assessment dates will be set by the Secretary, not earlier than 1 year after the grant is awarded. Real property purchased, renovated, constructed, or improved with grant funds must protect the federal interest. The Secretary must ensure protection of the Federal Government's interest in real property funded under this paragraph. Eligible applicants receiving funds must distribute them to local organizations for self-sustaining job programs. $200,000,000 is appropriated for grants in fiscal year 2013. The Secretary may require repayment of funds if a recipient fails to meet job placement goals of a self-sustaining job program. Repayment must be made over a 10-fiscal-year period starting from the date of determination. The Secretary may require repayment of funds if job placement goals are not met in a self-sustaining job program. Repayment can be made over a 10-fiscal-year period, with no interest accruing. Recipients can elect to comply with job placement goals instead of making payments, subject to Secretary's approval. States failing to comply may have their grant reduced over the same 10-year period. The Secretary may require repayment of funds if job placement goals are not met in a self-sustaining job program.

States failing to comply may have their grant reduced under section 403(a)(1) in the same amount and over the same 10-fiscal-year period that such payments would have been made. Subsections (c) and (d) shall not apply in the case of any penalty under this paragraph, except for a penalty with respect to which reductions are made under subparagraph (D). Section 409(b)(2) of the Social Security Act is amended by excluding penalties under paragraph (17) from the state reasonable cause exception. [SEC. 3. OFFSET TO ENSURE PAYGO COMPLIANCE.]"
