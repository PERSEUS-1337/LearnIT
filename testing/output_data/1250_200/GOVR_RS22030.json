    "content": "The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the discovery of Al Qaeda cells in Europe spurred EU efforts to combat terrorism and enhance cooperation in police, judicial, and intelligence matters. The EU, a unique partnership of 28 member states, aims to harmonize policies in \"justice and home affairs\" to promote internal security, protect citizens' rights, and facilitate free movement within the EU. This includes countering terrorism, cross-border crimes, police and judicial cooperation, migration, asylum issues, and border control policies in the Schengen area. The 2001 terrorist attacks in Europe prompted EU leaders to address the challenges of open borders and different legal systems that allowed terrorists to move freely. Law enforcement efforts post-attacks led to arrests in several European countries, highlighting the need for enhanced cooperation in justice and home affairs. The EU's open borders and legal differences facilitated terrorist movement and evasion of arrest. Lack of anti-terrorist legislation and extradition delays hindered apprehension. EU leaders recognized the need for harmonizing laws and enhancing cross-border cooperation to combat terrorism effectively. The EU took steps to combat terrorism by establishing common definitions, enhancing extradition processes, and improving intelligence sharing among member states' law enforcement authorities. This included creating a common list of terrorist groups, an EU arrest warrant, tools to stem terrorist financing, and strengthening border controls and aviation security. The EU also bolstered Europol and Eurojust to handle criminal intelligence and improve prosecutorial coordination. Subsequent incidents in Europe, such as the 2004 Madrid bombings, further emphasized the need to enhance EU counterterrorism capabilities. The Counterterrorism Coordinator in the EU was tasked with improving intelligence sharing and implementing anti-terrorism policies. The 2005 London bombings by homegrown extremists raised concerns about Muslim integration and radicalization. The EU adopted a plan in 2005 to combat radicalization and terrorism, focusing on disrupting terrorist networks, promoting mainstream opinions, and enhancing security measures. The EU has since expanded its efforts to combat terrorism, radicalization, and violent extremism. EU has expanded its definition of terrorism to include new criminal offenses such as terrorist recruitment, providing training, and public provocation. They established the Radicalisation Awareness Network in 2011 to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism. Despite efforts to enhance EU-wide cooperation against terrorism, common policies remain a work in progress due to national sovereignty concerns and differing views among member states and EU institutions. Despite efforts to enhance EU-wide cooperation against terrorism, forging common EU policies remains a work in progress. National sovereignty concerns and differing views among member states and EU institutions complicate harmonizing laws or concluding EU-wide policies in the JHA field. Challenges in sharing information among national police and intelligence services have been evident in recent EU efforts to address the threat posed by terrorist organizations like the Islamic State. EU authorities suggest that up to 5,000 EU citizens may have traveled to fight in conflict zones in the Middle East and North Africa. EU authorities estimate that up to 5,000 EU citizens have traveled to fight in conflict zones like Syria and Iraq since 2011. Security services are concerned about the potential threat posed by trained militants returning to Europe, as well as individuals inspired by extremist propaganda to carry out attacks at home. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe, such as the Brussels Jewish Museum shooting and the Paris Charlie Hebdo attacks, have raised fears of links to groups like Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. The attacks in Europe by French-born Muslims with ties to Al Qaeda or the Islamic State include shootings in Copenhagen, Denmark, a thwarted train attack from Amsterdam to Paris, and coordinated attacks in Paris that left 130 dead. Authorities have confirmed the identities of seven assailants, most of whom were French or Belgian citizens with links to the Islamic State in Syria-Iraq. EU governments are combating the foreign fighter threat, with the EU taking a leading role. The recent attacks in Europe have exposed weaknesses in domestic security and border controls, with difficulties in monitoring potential assailants and insufficient information sharing among EU countries' law enforcement and intelligence services. Perpetrators have exploited the Schengen system and chaos from migrant influxes. Some attackers traveled between European countries before the attacks, and the suspected ringleader of the Paris attacks traveled between Europe and Syria despite being known to security services. Two attackers entered Europe through Greece with fake Syrian passports. The EU has faced challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and the foreign fighter threat due to issues related to sovereignty and balancing security with human rights. Despite some progress on initiatives, skepticism remains about their effectiveness. Key steps include enhancing information sharing. EU officials have been encouraging national authorities to share information on suspected foreign fighters and make greater use of existing common EU databases, such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) and Europol's Focal Point Travellers database. In January 2016, Europol launched a European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC) for information sharing and operational cooperation among member states. Success of these initiatives depends on receiving information from national authorities, with an increase in alerts entered into SIS and information contributed to Europol databases noted over the past year. EU officials have been pushing for increased information sharing on suspected foreign fighters among national authorities. Despite an increase in alerts entered into SIS and information contributed to Europol databases, some argue that EU-wide terrorism-related information sharing is still lacking. The proposal for an EU-wide Passenger Name Record (PNR) system has been stalled since 2013 due to data privacy concerns, but gained momentum after the 2015 Paris attacks. The system aims to facilitate information sharing on foreign fighters and enhance tracking of their movements. Harmonization of PNR collection practices across the EU is seen as crucial. The EU PNR proposal aims to harmonize PNR collection practices across the EU, obliging airlines to provide PNR data to national authorities. Critics argue it infringes on data privacy rights, while others believe it doesn't go far enough in sharing PNR data. The agreement is expected to be finalized in early 2016, with a two-year implementation period for EU governments. The EU is working on establishing a centralized PNR database, with a two-year implementation period for EU governments. Concerns about the foreign fighter threat led to calls for increased security tools at external borders, but resistance to amending the Schengen Borders Code remains. Pressure on the Schengen system due to migrants and attacks in Paris prompted a proposal for mandatory checks of EU citizens against law enforcement databases. The EU proposed modifications to the Schengen Borders Code for mandatory checks of EU citizens against law enforcement databases at external borders. They also suggested creating a European Border and Coast Guard. Efforts to establish an EU border guard corps have faced sovereignty concerns. The EU is focused on detecting and removing online content promoting terrorism through the Internet Referral Unit and Internet Forum. The EU launched an Internet Forum in December 2015 to counter terrorist propaganda online and called on member states to address societal factors contributing to radicalization. Efforts are being made to revise the Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training throughout the EU, despite challenges in harmonizing criminal laws due to varying national policies. The EU is working to update the common terrorism definition to address gaps in laws related to foreign fighters, in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. The European Commission proposed revisions in December 2015, which will be reviewed by EU member states and the European Parliament. Cooperation between the EU and the U.S. in combating terrorism has been a priority since 9/11, with efforts to improve law enforcement and intelligence sharing. The EU and U.S. have been cooperating to combat terrorism since 9/11, with a focus on improving law enforcement and intelligence sharing. This partnership has led to increased dialogue on security issues and a positive evolution in relations. The EU is also a key partner in global counterterrorism efforts. The U.S. and EU have been cooperating on counterterrorism efforts since 9/11, focusing on law enforcement and intelligence sharing. The EU is a key partner in the Global Counterterrorism Forum, established in 2011 to combat violent extremism and enhance international cooperation against terrorism. Recent efforts have centered on addressing the foreign fighter phenomenon, with concerns about European and American Muslims joining Islamist groups in Syria and Iraq. US policymakers are particularly worried about European foreign fighters due to visa-free travel arrangements between the US and most EU countries. Attorney General Eric Holder emphasized the need for shared strategies to confront the influx of violent extremists returning from Syria. In September 2014, the U.S. and EU officials collaborated on measures to address the foreign fighter threat, including counter-radicalization and border security. EU countries supported U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 to combat the global foreign fighter phenomenon. After the Paris attacks in January 2015, U.S. and European officials discussed terrorist threats and foreign fighters. The EU's open borders pose challenges for U.S. officials in countering violent extremism. Key participants in the February 2015 conference on countering violent extremism hosted by the United States in Washington, DC emphasized the importance of intra-European information exchanges and the use of existing EU-wide databases. President Obama called on the EU to implement agreements for sharing passenger information to prevent foreign terrorist fighters from entering countries undetected. Close law enforcement ties with European allies and existing U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements are crucial in combating the foreign fighter phenomenon. Challenges remain in the evolving U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship, particularly regarding data privacy. Challenges persist in the U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship, including data privacy concerns and negotiations on information-sharing agreements. Issues such as detainee policies, terrorist designation lists, and border security measures have also caused tensions. Legislation passed in 2015 to enhance the security of the U.S. Visa Waiver Program has raised some worries in the EU. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on law enforcement and border control policies have increased significantly since 2001. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on law enforcement and border control policies have increased significantly since 2001, with active engagement from various U.S. departments. High-level meetings and working groups discuss police, judicial cooperation, terrorist financing, and border security issues. Expert-level dialogues on critical infrastructure protection and preventing violent extremism have also taken place, along with the establishment of reciprocal liaison relationships between U.S. and EU agencies. U.S. and EU agencies have established reciprocal liaison relationships for counterterrorism and international crimes. Europol has liaison officers in Washington, DC, and the U.S. has officers at Europol headquarters in The Hague. This cooperation has led to operational successes in countering transnational crimes, including online \"dark net\" marketplaces. Additionally, a U.S. liaison works at Eurojust headquarters to facilitate cooperation on terrorism and cross-border criminal cases. U.S.-EU efforts against terrorism have resulted in accords to improve police and judicial cooperation. In 2001 and 2002, U.S.-Europol agreements were made to share strategic and personal information for improved police and judicial cooperation in counterterrorism efforts. Negotiations were challenging due to EU data protection standards. In 2007, a security agreement for classified information exchange was signed, and in 2010, extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties between the U.S. and EU came into force. In 2010, new U.S.-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance entered into force to harmonize existing bilateral accords, simplify extradition processes, and enhance information-sharing for combating terrorism and transnational crimes. Challenges included addressing the U.S. death penalty and extradition of EU nationals. Washington agreed to EU demands that extradited suspects will not face the death penalty, and the treaty does not guarantee the extradition of any EU national. The U.S. and EU have reached agreements on extradition and mutual legal assistance to enhance cooperation in combating terrorism and transnational crimes. The extradition accord modernizes existing agreements, streamlines information exchange, and sets rules for competing extradition requests. The MLA treaty grants U.S. access to European financial information, speeds up request processing, allows evidence acquisition via video conferencing, and permits U.S. participation in joint EU investigations. Despite some critics doubting the utility of collaborating with EU-wide bodies, the agreements aim to strengthen law enforcement ties between the U.S. and EU. Europol's effectiveness relies on national services sharing information. European officials criticize the US for not sharing intelligence. Despite challenges, US and EU officials are committed to enhancing cooperation. Agreements have been signed to improve cooperation against foreign fighters and illegal immigration. The US and EU collaborate on tracking terrorist financing in global forums. The United States and the EU collaborate in global forums to track and suppress terrorist financing. They benefit from an agreement allowing access to financial data through the SWIFT consortium. The TFTP has provided thousands of investigative leads, aiding in the prevention of terrorist attacks in Europe. However, privacy concerns in Europe remain regarding the sharing of SWIFT data. U.S. and EU officials have collaborated since 2001 to bridge gaps in their lists of terrorist individuals and groups. The EU maintains two lists - one focusing on Al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates, and the other on non-affiliated entities. The EU's \"common terrorist list\" includes over 80 entities and has been a subject of U.S.-EU debate. The EU's \"common terrorist list\" includes over 80 individuals or entities, with different law enforcement measures applied based on whether they are considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. \"External\" individuals and groups have their assets frozen and face financial restrictions, while \"internal\" ones are subject to strengthened police cooperation measures. National governments also impose their own sanctions to prevent financing for \"internal\" entities. The EU's common terrorist list includes over 80 individuals or entities, with different law enforcement measures applied based on whether they are considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. National governments generally seek to apply their own sanctions to stem financing for such individuals and entities. Unanimous agreement among all EU member states is required for a person or entity to be added to or deleted from the list. The United States and other countries have successfully lobbied the EU to add several organizations to the list, but harmonizing the U.S. and EU terrorist designation lists has caused occasional frictions. The EU hesitates to add suspected Hamas-related charities to its terrorist list due to some members viewing them as separate entities engaged in political or social work. Charities like Interpal have been investigated but cleared of funding Hamas. EU member states were divided on including Hezbollah on the terrorist list, with the US considering it a foreign terrorist organization. France and other members opposed adding Hezbollah to the list. In 2012-2013, the EU debated adding Hezbollah to its terrorist list following events like the Burgas airport bombing and a Hezbollah operative's conviction in Cyprus. Calls from the US and Israel for inclusion were prompted by Hezbollah's involvement in Syria's civil war and support for the Assad government. In late July 2013, the EU announced the addition of Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, following appeals due to their involvement in Syria's civil war. This decision was seen as a compromise to avoid destabilizing Lebanon and maintain EU influence in the region. The EU emphasized that dialogue with political parties in Lebanon and humanitarian assistance would continue despite this designation. The EU's decision to add Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list was largely symbolic, sending a message that terrorist activities would endanger its legitimacy. Some experts hoped this would lead to enhanced intelligence investigations in Europe. Critics argued that allowing Hezbollah to fundraise in Europe was insufficient. The US had long urged the EU to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, especially after Hezbollah's involvement in the Burgas bombing. In response to the Burgas bombing, US lawmakers urged the EU to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization and impose sanctions. The EU's decision to list Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist group was seen as a positive step, but data privacy issues remain a sticking point in sharing information to disrupt terrorist activities. EU data privacy regulations set common rules for public and private entities in the EU that hold or transmit personal data, prohibiting transfer to countries without adequate legal protections. Concerns have been raised in U.S.-EU information-sharing accords about the protection of European citizens' personal data, especially after unauthorized disclosures of U.S. surveillance programs. This has strained transatlantic trust and exacerbated EU worries about U.S. data protection safeguards. Many analysts are concerned about the future of U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements due to strained transatlantic trust and EU worries about data protection. The European Parliament has opposed accords like SWIFT and the U.S.-EU Passenger Name Record agreement. In response to reported U.S. surveillance programs, the Parliament established a working group chaired by Claude Moraes, which adopted the critical \"Moraes report\" in March 2014. In March 2014, the European Parliament adopted the \"Moraes report,\" chaired by Claude Moraes, criticizing NSA's mass surveillance programs and calling for revisions in U.S. legislation to protect EU citizens' privacy rights. The report also raised concerns about U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements like SWIFT and urged the conclusion of negotiations on the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement. The European Parliament demanded stronger data protection reforms in response to reported NSA programs and U.S. spying activities. New data protection rules were agreed upon in December 2015, with concerns raised by U.S. officials about potential impacts on law enforcement cooperation and U.S. companies. The U.S. reassured EU leaders that surveillance activities comply with U.S. law and oversight, aiming to address EU concerns and maintain support for agreements like SWIFT and PNR. The EU has been addressing concerns about U.S. surveillance programs, including the PRISM program, to maintain European support for agreements like SWIFT and PNR. A high-level U.S.-EU working group was established to assess the proportionality of such programs and their implications for EU citizens' privacy rights. The European Commission issued a report with recommendations to address European concerns about U.S.-EU data flows and restore transatlantic trust. U.S. policymakers have been considering ways to implement some of the Commission's proposals, including providing EU citizens with the right to pursue redress in U.S. courts for certain law enforcement data privacy violations. In the 114th Congress, the Judicial Redress Act (H.R. 1428 and S. 1600) was passed to allow EU citizens to seek redress in U.S. courts for law enforcement data privacy violations. Controversy over U.S. access to SWIFT financial data for counterterrorism purposes raised concerns in Europe, leading to a deal in 2007 to address privacy worries. In 2009, changes to SWIFT's systems architecture required a new U.S.-EU agreement for sharing data. The European Parliament rejected the new SWIFT accord in 2010 due to concerns about data protection for EU citizens. In 2010, the European Parliament raised concerns about data privacy and civil liberties regarding U.S. access to SWIFT data. MEPs wanted more targeted transfers and judicial remedy for European citizens in the U.S. A new draft SWIFT agreement was concluded in June 2010 to address these concerns. In June 2010, a new draft SWIFT agreement was concluded between the U.S. and EU officials. The draft included provisions for administrative and legal redress for EU citizens in the U.S. and gave Europol authority over U.S. Treasury Department requests for SWIFT data. To address concerns, an independent observer appointed by the European Commission would oversee the extraction of SWIFT data in Washington, DC. Additionally, plans for a European equivalent to the U.S. TFTP were required within a year to enable the EU to extract and transfer SWIFT data to U.S. authorities. The European Parliament approved the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord in July 2010, allowing for targeted data transfers to the U.S. without bulk data transfers. Despite concerns about implementation, the agreement entered into force in August 2010 for a five-year period, with automatic extensions unless notified otherwise. Reviews in 2011 and 2012 recommended measures for transparency in the TFTP, including providing more information to Europol. The European Parliament approved the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord in July 2010, allowing targeted data transfers to the U.S. The agreement entered into force in August 2010 for a five-year period, with automatic extensions unless notified otherwise. In December 2012, a second review concluded that the TFTP had benefits in fighting terrorism, with proper safeguards. Unauthorized disclosures of U.S. surveillance activities in Europe since June 2013 raised concerns in the European Parliament about U.S. handling of EU citizens' data. In October 2013, the Parliament passed a resolution calling for the immediate suspension of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord due to NSA monitoring allegations. In March 2014, the European Parliament approved the \"Moraes report\" asserting that the U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement should be suspended, but actual suspension would require action from the European Commission and member states. Reviews in late 2013 and mid-2014 showed that SWIFT data helped European intelligence services in investigating terrorist threats. In May 2004, the U.S. and EU reached an agreement allowing airlines to provide passenger data to U.S. authorities, which was controversial in Europe due to privacy concerns. In 2004, the US and EU reached an agreement allowing airlines to provide passenger data to US authorities, sparking privacy concerns in Europe. The European Parliament challenged the agreement in court, leading to its annulment in 2006. In 2007, a new seven-year agreement was negotiated, granting the US more access to PNR data and extending data storage time to 15 years. The 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement allowed the United States access to sensitive passenger information, with airlines required to send data 72 hours before a flight. The European Parliament had concerns about data transfer, storage time, and citizen redress, but agreed to postpone the vote in May 2010. The European Parliament postponed its vote on the 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement in May 2010, calling for a \"global external PNR strategy\" from the European Commission. In September 2010, the Commission proposed principles for PNR agreements, including limited data use, passenger rights, and data retention limits. In November 2010, the European Parliament endorsed new PNR negotiations with the United States, emphasizing the need for data exchange to be \"necessary\" and \"proportional.\" The Obama Administration agreed to discuss adjustments to the PNR accord, recognizing the EP's concerns. U.S.-EU negotiations on a revised PNR accord began in December 2010, with U.S. officials maintaining that privacy rights were protected under the 2007 accord. In mid-May 2011, resolutions were introduced in the House (H.Res. 255) and passed in the Senate (S.Res. 174) essentially supporting the existing 2007 U.S.-EU PNR accord and urging DHS to reject any efforts by the EU to modify the agreement in a way that would degrade its usefulness in the fight against terrorism. In late May 2011, the United States and the European Commission concluded negotiations on a revised PNR agreement, a draft of which was leaked to the press. According to U.S. officials, the draft contained new innovations to enhance the protection of passengers' personal information. The May 2011 agreement introduced innovations to enhance passenger data protection, including depersonalizing and masking portions of records after six months, reducing storage time in an active database, and limiting access to authorized personnel. The draft accord provided legal clarity on passenger rights and ensured the U.S. would not deny boarding based solely on PNR data processing. It also allowed for consultation if the EU developed its own PNR system in the future. Despite revisions, some MEPs were still unsatisfied with the U.S.-EU PNR agreement. The May 2011 version of the U.S.-EU PNR accord allowed the United States to retain passenger data for up to 15 years, with some MEPs concerned about broadening the use of PNR data for criminal offenses. U.S. officials claimed the draft was stronger than the 2007 version, addressing EU concerns on data security, protection, and passenger rights. In November 2011, a new draft PNR agreement was concluded between the United States and the EU, addressing concerns on data security, offenses covered, and passenger rights. Changes were made to limit data use to terrorist or serious crimes with varying retention times. EU member states approved the agreement in December 2011, with some concerns remaining about data retention and redress provisions. Some MEPs had concerns about the data retention and redress provisions in the new U.S.-EU PNR accord, viewing them as insufficient. Despite some misgivings, the full Parliament approved the agreement in April 2012 by a vote of 409 to 226, with 33 abstentions. U.S. officials welcomed the endorsement, emphasizing the shared commitment to countering terrorism while protecting privacy and civil rights. The U.S.-EU PNR accord, adopted in April 2012 and in force since August 2012, reaffirmed the commitment to counter terrorism while protecting privacy and civil rights. A joint review in November 2013 found the agreement effective in fighting terrorism and serious crimes, but concerns were raised about U.S. data protection safeguards. In March 2014, the European Parliament called for reassurance on the adequacy of U.S. laws for data protection. The European Parliament's resolution in March 2014 raised concerns about the protection of PNR data in cloud systems on U.S. soil. U.S. and EU leaders view information-sharing agreements like SWIFT and PNR as crucial in combating terrorism. Efforts have been made to establish a U.S.-EU framework agreement to streamline negotiations on data-sharing accords. In May 2010, the European Commission proposed a draft mandate for negotiating an overarching Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) with the United States to bridge privacy rights differences. EU member states approved the mandate in December 2010, and negotiations officially began in March 2011. The agreement aimed to protect personal information exchanged in a law enforcement context based on mutual recognition of data protection systems between the U.S. and EU. The U.S.-EU accord aimed to be based on mutual recognition of data protection systems, ensuring privacy rights for citizens. Negotiations focused on data security, transparency, and oversight. Controversial issues included purpose limitation and redress rights for EU citizens in the U.S. The U.S.-EU accord aimed to ensure privacy rights for citizens through mutual recognition of data protection systems. Negotiations focused on data security, transparency, and oversight. Controversial issues included extending judicial redress to EU citizens in the U.S., with discussions stalled until U.S. surveillance revelations injected renewed momentum. The European Parliament urged the U.S. to revise its legislation to provide EU citizens with the right to judicial redress. The U.S.-EU accord aimed to ensure privacy rights for citizens through mutual recognition of data protection systems. Negotiations focused on data security, transparency, and oversight. The European Parliament urged the U.S. to revise its legislation to provide EU citizens with the right to judicial redress. In June 2014, then-U.S. Attorney General Holder announced the Obama Administration's commitment to seeking legislation to ensure EU citizens have the same right to seek judicial redress for privacy violations as U.S. citizens. This decision was seen as an effort to restore EU trust in U.S. data privacy commitments. U.S. and EU negotiators finalized and initialed the text of the DPPA in September 2015, but the EU stated it would not be signed until U.S. judicial redress was guaranteed. In September 2015, U.S. and EU negotiators finalized the text of the DPPA, pending U.S. judicial redress legislation adoption. To meet EU demands, the Judicial Redress Act was introduced in March 2015 by Representatives Sensenbrenner and Conyers, and in June 2015 by Senators Murphy and Hatch. The Act aimed to extend judicial redress provisions to citizens of covered countries with privacy agreements like the DPPA. Congressional action on the Act became crucial after a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union in October 2015. The Redress Act gained importance after the CJEU invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement due to inadequate data protection and lack of judicial remedies for EU citizens in the U.S. The Act aimed to address European concerns about data transfers and strengthen confidence in the new Privacy Shield. The Judicial Redress Act, H.R. 1428, passed in the U.S. to address concerns about data transfers in a law enforcement context. It includes provisions for citizens of countries that allow data transfer to the U.S. for commercial purposes without impeding national security interests. The Act played a role in the U.S.-EU provisional agreement on Privacy Shield. The U.S.-EU provisional agreement on Privacy Shield was further supported by the enactment of the Judicial Redress Act, H.R. 1428, which was signed into law on February 24, 2016. The European Commission welcomed the act's enactment, stating that it will pave the way for the signature of the U.S.-EU Data Protection and Privacy Agreement (DPPA). The approval process for the DPPA by EU member states and the European Parliament could take several months. Cooperation between the United States and the EU in border control, aviation, and maritime security has been emphasized over the last decade. The United States and the EU have collaborated on border control, aviation, and maritime security, including agreements on information exchange and biometric identifiers. They have worked together to strengthen aviation security measures globally and improve cargo and supply chain security. Efforts have been made to balance security enhancements with facilitating legitimate transatlantic travel and commerce. Since the 2001 terrorist attacks, the U.S. and EU have implemented measures to enhance aviation security. Recent incidents, such as the 2009 underwear bomb attempt and the 2010 Yemen bomb plot, have reignited discussions on air cargo security. Tighter rules for carrying electronic devices on U.S.-bound flights were introduced in 2014 due to concerns about potential threats from Al Qaeda-linked groups. The U.S. and EU have implemented measures to enhance aviation security since the 2001 terrorist attacks. Recent incidents have reignited discussions on air cargo security, leading to tighter rules for carrying electronic devices on U.S.-bound flights in 2014. The ongoing terrorist threat to aviation is highlighted by concerns about Al Qaeda-linked groups using devices to disguise explosives. The U.S. and EU have worked together to bridge policy gaps, including agreements on armed air marshals and coordinating air cargo security measures. The United States and the EU have reached an agreement on an air cargo security partnership to comply with the 100% screening mandate for cargo on U.S. domestic and U.S.-bound international passenger flights. This partnership aims to eliminate duplication of security controls, enhance cargo security, and save time and money for operators on both sides. Additionally, both parties will exchange information on the evolution and implementation of their security regimes. The EU and the US have agreed on a partnership for air cargo security to meet the 100% screening requirement for cargo on passenger flights. Despite shared goals, differences exist in perspectives on security measures such as body scanners. Some EU countries were hesitant due to privacy and health concerns, but the European Parliament eventually supported the use of body scanners with safeguards in place. The European Parliament recommended safeguards for body scanners at airports to protect passenger privacy and health. These included using stick figure images, banning x-ray scans, and making the use of scanners voluntary. In 2011, the European Commission adopted these conditions for EU airports, but deployment is not mandatory for member states. Concerns were raised about body scanners at U.S. airports by EU officials, but in 2013, the TSA announced the removal of full-body scanners producing revealing images. In June 2013, the TSA announced the removal of full-body scanners producing revealing images at U.S. airports. Concerns were raised by EU officials about body scanners, but the United States and the EU have worked to harmonize restrictions on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage to minimize inconvenience for travelers. In 2010, the EU announced plans to eliminate restrictions on liquids in cabin baggage by April 2013, but concerns were raised by U.S. policymakers and some EU governments about the effectiveness of current liquid-screening technology. The EU postponed the deadline for introducing liquid screening equipment and lifting all restrictions on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage, with a goal to end all restrictions by January 2016. In April 2004, the US and EU signed a customs cooperation accord to extend the US Container Security Initiative (CSI) throughout the EU. CSI involves US customs officers stationed in foreign ports to pre-screen maritime cargo containers for dangerous substances. The US and EU also agreed to recognize each other's trusted shipper programs in May 2012, aiming to improve supply chain security and trade opportunities for trusted traders. This mutual recognition accord is intended to simplify customs procedures for designated companies and focus resources on risky consignments. Recently, U.S.-EU tensions have receded over the provision in the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 that set a five-year goal of scanning all containers bound for the United States for nuclear devices at foreign ports. EU officials viewed 100% container scanning as unrealistic and argued that it could disrupt trade and place a heavy financial burden on EU ports and businesses. U.S. policymakers shared concerns about the cost and effectiveness of 100% scanning, suggesting it could result in lower profits and higher transportation costs for U.S. importers. In response, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security extended the 100% scanning deadline by two years in 2012 and announced an additional two-year extension in 2014. Homeland Security extended the 100% scanning deadline by two years in July 2012 and announced another two-year extension in June 2014. Proponents argue that manifest data is not sufficient for determining container risk. The U.S. Visa Waiver Program allows visa-free travel for citizens of 38 countries, mostly in Europe. New EU members were excluded from the VWP due to not meeting requirements, causing tensions over visa reciprocity between the U.S. and EU. In July 2007, Congress passed the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-53), which made changes to the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) to enhance security measures and allow more EU members to qualify. The act required VWP countries to meet security standards, share information, and submit biographical information through ESTA for travelers entering the United States. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) requires biographical information from participating countries through ESTA. P.L. 110-53 allowed waivers for certain admission requirements, enabling new EU member states to join. Currently, 23 out of 28 EU member states are part of the VWP. The EU urges the US to include the remaining five members. A revised EU reciprocity mechanism aims to achieve full visa reciprocity with the US and other countries. The European Commission may suspend visa-free travel for a country without full reciprocity. The European Commission has not yet suspended visa-free travel under the new reciprocity mechanism, but is actively assessing the situation every six months. U.S. officials are concerned about Europeans fighting in Syria and Iraq who can easily return home and enter the U.S. without a visa. The Obama Administration supports the VWP for transatlantic commerce and tourism, but has implemented enhanced security measures for VWP travelers. The Obama Administration implemented enhanced security measures for the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) following the November 2015 attacks in Paris. Changes included capturing past travel to terrorist safe havens in ESTA, evaluating cooperation with VWP countries, and enhancing terrorism information sharing. Congress passed legislation to further strengthen VWP security. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) was enhanced with the Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 to improve security. The new legislation restricts individuals who have traveled to certain countries from entering the US under the VWP. Additionally, VWP participant countries must issue electronic passports and implement screening protocols. EU officials have expressed concerns about the new VWP requirements. EU officials are concerned about the new Visa Waiver Program (VWP) requirements, arguing they could create a de facto visa regime and discriminate against dual nationals. They question the effectiveness of the legislation, stating it may impact legitimate travelers more than detecting potential terrorists. The US has exemptions for government and military personnel, with the Secretary of DHS able to waive exclusion on a case-by-case basis. EU leaders warn of possible reciprocal measures, potentially restricting visa-free travel for US citizens. EU leaders and Members of Congress are concerned about potential reciprocal measures regarding visa-free travel to Europe for U.S. citizens. Legislation has been introduced to eliminate VWP restrictions on dual nationals. U.S. and European officials emphasize the importance of balancing freedom and security without sacrificing civil liberties and human rights standards. Tensions between the U.S. and Europe have arisen over the treatment of suspected terrorist detainees. The treatment of suspected terrorist detainees has been a point of tension between the U.S. and Europe, especially during the George W. Bush Administration. U.S. policies such as Guantanamo Bay, military commissions, enhanced interrogation techniques, and extraordinary rendition have faced criticism in Europe. European leaders viewed these policies as breaching international and European law, degrading human rights values, and weakening U.S.-European relations. The Bush Administration defended its detainee and rendition policies as important tools in the fight against terrorism, despite European concerns about Guantanamo. Frictions over terrorist detainee policies have subsided somewhat since the start of the Obama Administration, with EU officials welcoming plans to close Guantanamo and ban torture. The Obama Administration faced challenges in closing Guantanamo, with some EU countries accepting released detainees while others declined. Congressional opposition and restrictions hindered transfer efforts, leading to frustration over reluctance from other countries to take in more detainees. The Obama Administration has faced obstacles in closing Guantanamo, with concerns about released detainees engaging in terrorist activity. In March 2011, President Obama signed an executive order allowing indefinite detention for dangerous detainees. European policymakers worry that Guantanamo serves as a recruiting tool for terrorist groups. The European Parliament has called for the closure of the facility, while the Obama Administration remains committed to shutting it down. The Obama Administration is committed to closing Guantanamo Bay. In 2013 and 2015, Congress passed bills easing restrictions on transferring detainees. President Obama sent a proposal to Congress in 2016 to close the facility before the end of his term. Out of nearly 800 detainees, 147 have been resettled overseas. The Obama Administration aimed to close Guantanamo Bay before the end of his term in January 2017. Out of nearly 800 detainees, 147 have been resettled overseas. European concerns persist about the role of EU member states in U.S. terrorist detainee policies, with the European Parliament calling for investigations into alleged CIA detention facilities and rendition flights. The European Parliament is calling for investigations into alleged CIA detention facilities and rendition flights following the Obama Administration's efforts to close Guantanamo Bay. The resolution calls for cooperation between the US and EU on counter-terrorism efforts. Efforts to enhance U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism have been ongoing since the 2001 attacks on the United States. The George W. Bush Administration prioritized engaging the EU on police and judicial matters despite initial skepticism. Improved cooperation on border controls and transport security aims to track suspected terrorists and prevent their entry into the U.S. or sanctuary in Europe. However, U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation faces challenges due to differing competencies and policy preferences. The United States and the European Union (EU) have ongoing efforts to enhance cooperation against terrorism since the 2001 attacks. Despite occasional tensions, both sides are committed to closer collaboration in areas such as counterterrorism, law enforcement, border controls, and transport security. The Obama Administration has continued the Bush Administration's policy of engagement with the EU in these areas. U.S.-EU cooperation against terrorism is seen as crucial in combating threats from European and American citizens fighting with Islamist groups. Aviation and cargo security, U.S. border control measures, and visa policy are key issues that could impact future cooperation. Congressional hearings have focused on the threats posed by Western foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. In the 113th and 114th Congresses, hearings focused on threats from Western foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. Congress passed the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 to enhance security controls. Intelligence reforms and data privacy laws could impact U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation. The U.S. Judicial Redress Act was welcomed by EU officials for improving data privacy agreements. The United States made gestures to rebuild trust in U.S.-EU information-sharing and data flows. Members of Congress engaged with European Parliament on surveillance issues, with Representative Jim Sensenbrenner testifying in 2013. Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Mike Rogers led congressional delegations to Europe to discuss alleged U.S. intelligence activities. Mike Rogers, then-chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, led congressional delegations to Europe to discuss alleged U.S. intelligence activities with European officials and reaffirm the importance of U.S.-European relations. Members of Congress have ongoing contacts with European Parliament counterparts, and the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) facilitates discussions on foreign policy and economic issues. There is interest in strengthening ties between the two bodies to enhance transatlantic dialogue on counterterrorism issues."
