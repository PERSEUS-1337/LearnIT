The Act \"Name Matching for Enforcement and Security Act of 2001\" mandates the development of a unified electronic data system by key government agencies to facilitate visa issuance and alien admissibility determinations. The system must have name search capacity, linguistic sensitivity, user support, and private sector consultation. The unified electronic database mandated by the \"Name Matching for Enforcement and Security Act of 2001\" must have linguistically sensitive searches using algorithms that account for variations in name formats and transliterations. It should also provide user support, be developed in consultation with private sector firms, utilize commercially available platforms, and be continuously adjusted and improved based on experience and advancements in technology and sciences. The unified electronic data system mandated by the \"Name Matching for Enforcement and Security Act of 2001\" must incorporate advanced linguistic, mathematical, statistical, and anthropological research methods. Linguistically sensitive algorithms for at least 4 high-priority languages will be developed. Adequate user support will include information on names in different languages and a means to communicate with experts. Interim reports will be provided every 6 months. The \"Name Matching for Enforcement and Security Act of 2001\" mandates a unified electronic data system incorporating advanced research methods.

The Director of Intelligence will issue guidelines and consult with various agencies in developing a data system under the \"Name Matching for Enforcement and Security Act of 2001\". Appropriations are authorized for this purpose, and the system will utilize established technology standards.
