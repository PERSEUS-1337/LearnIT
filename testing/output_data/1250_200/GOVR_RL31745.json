These pools help comply with HIPAA regulations for portability and guaranteed availability of coverage. States can choose to enforce federal HIPAA rules or establish their own alternative mechanisms like high risk pools. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) established a temporary high risk pool program to provide health insurance coverage to individuals with preexisting conditions before 2014. State high risk pools enroll a small percentage of the uninsured, with limited enrollment due to their narrow focus on individuals with preexisting health conditions seeking coverage in the private market. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established a temporary high risk pool program to provide health insurance coverage to individuals with preexisting conditions before 2014. High risk pools fill a niche in the health insurance system, catering to those with preexisting conditions who have been uninsured for six months or more. These pools are part of the patchwork system of private markets and public programs designed to meet the needs of different types of health care consumers. Individuals who do not qualify for employer-offered health benefits or are unemployed may seek health insurance through public programs or the individual market. The individual market requires robust medical underwriting, where insurers assess an applicant's health conditions and other factors to determine policy terms. In contrast, the group market typically does not involve underwriting. In the individual market, insurers may request a physical exam or medical specimens. Insurers in the group market do not underwrite individually but calculate premiums based on the group's overall characteristics. Federal and state laws limit insurers from rejecting applicants based on health factors, but some may still be rejected or offered coverage with exclusions or higher premiums. The individual market tends to have a healthier enrollee population. High risk pools are designed to assist individuals with moderate to severe health conditions who are excluded from the individual market. Supporters believe that states can efficiently insure previously uninsurable individuals and stabilize the market by removing high-risk persons and placing them in publicly subsidized insurance pools. This approach is favored by policymakers who prefer incremental coverage expansion and state oversight of health insurance. High risk pools stabilize the market, promote competition, and provide a safety net for the nongroup market. However, they are often too small and underfunded to meet the needs of many uninsured individuals. Federal attempts to subsidize losses are limited, making coverage unaffordable for some. State high risk pools may exclude coverage for preexisting conditions, leading to skepticism about their ability to reduce the number of uninsured individuals, especially those with serious medical conditions. Consumer groups advocate for expanding the federal role in providing coverage through existing public programs or broader health care reform.

The federal government provides financial assistance to state high risk pools through grant programs administered by CMS. States can receive seed grants to establish new pools and operational grants for existing pools. Funding was first provided in 2002 through the Trade Act, with each qualifying state eligible for up to $1 million in seed grants. The Trade Act provided $20 million in seed grants to states for high risk pools. Six states received grants in 2003. An additional $80 million was allocated to cover operating losses for existing pools over FY2003 and FY2004. States had to meet certain criteria to qualify for the grants. The Trade Act provided seed grants to states for high risk pools in FY2003. States could determine out-of-pocket costs and benefits under federal standards. H.R. 4519 reauthorized federal grants through FY2010, changing the funding formula for operational grants. H.R. 4519 authorized grants to cover pool losses and allocated $15 million for seed grants and $75 million for operational and bonus grants in FY2006. The Senate and President Bush approved the bill, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 provided $90 million in appropriations for grants to states. The appropriations extended federal funding for the program. President Bush signed the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) into law on February 8, 2006, providing appropriations to extend federal funding for state high risk pools. CMS awarded seed grants to five states in 2006 and additional grants in 2007. Congress allocated more funding for state high risk pools in 2008.

HHS administers the program in 21 states under the name Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP)."
