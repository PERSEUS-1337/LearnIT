    "content": "The \"Facilitating Access to Speedy Transmissions for Networks, E-commerce and Telecommunications (FASTNET) Act\" is the short title of the legislation. The purpose of the Act is to facilitate access to speedy transmissions for networks, e-commerce, and telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition and reduce regulation in telecommunications markets to deploy advanced technologies nationwide. It recognized the unique position of local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, enabling them to accelerate the deployment of advanced services in less populated regions. Existing regulations tailored to larger carriers often burden these smaller carriers, hindering their deployment of advanced services. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition and reduce regulation in telecommunications markets to deploy advanced technologies nationwide. It recognized the disproportionate burdens on two percent carriers, hindering their deployment of advanced services in less populated regions. Reducing regulatory burdens on these carriers will enable them to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and competitive initiatives for the benefit of consumers in less densely populated regions of the Nation. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to reduce regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, allowing them to redirect resources to increase investment in advanced services for consumers in less populated regions. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to reduce regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, allowing them to redirect resources to increase investment in advanced services for consumers in less populated regions. This amendment defines a \"two percent carrier\" as an incumbent local exchange carrier with access lines totaling less than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, and provides regulatory relief for such carriers under a new part IV of the Communications Act of 1934. The Commission must consider the impact of regulatory requirements on two percent carriers when adopting rules for incumbent local exchange carriers. If the Commission fails to do so, the rule cannot be enforced on two percent carriers until a separate evaluation is conducted. No additional review is needed if the rules do not apply to two percent carriers or if they are exempted. Size-based differentiation among carriers is not prohibited by this section. The section allows for size-based differentiation among carriers and specifies that it does not prohibit such differentiation. The provisions of this section apply to rules adopted after the enactment date. SEC. 282 limits reporting requirements for two percent carriers, exempting them from filing cost allocation manuals or ARMIS reports, except for section 224. SEC. 283 addresses the integrated operation of two percent carriers. SEC. 283 states that the Commission cannot require a two percent carrier to have a separate affiliate for various services. This includes local and long-distance services, mobile radio, internet, and other enhanced services. Additionally, the Commission cannot mandate separate operations for carriers and their affiliates. The Commission cannot require a two percent carrier to participate in a common line tariff for all study areas. A carrier can elect to be regulated under price cap rate regulation for specific study areas. The carrier's election is binding for one year. A carrier's election under price cap rate regulation for specific study areas is binding for one year from the date of the election. The Commission allows two percent carriers to deploy new interstate telecommunications services with only one day's notice, without needing approval for rate structures. This includes services not previously offered that expand options for customers. Additionally, competing carriers can enter the market under Section 286. The Commission allows two percent carriers to de-average interstate rates with one day's notice and file contract-based tariffs upon certification of facilities-based entry by an unaffiliated carrier. Pricing flexibility is granted for interstate services, and streamlined pricing regulation is implemented for carriers with competing local exchange carriers entering the market. The Commission regulates two percent carriers as non-dominant if a local exchange carrier owned by a governmental authority enters their service area, allowing them to participate in the common line tariff. Facilities-based entry includes providing local telephone exchange switching and service within the carrier's service area. The term 'contract-based tariff' refers to a tariff based on a service contract between a two percent carrier and customers, including contract terms, service descriptions, volume commitments, prices, discounts, and other regulations. The curr_chunk provides a general description of classifications, practices, and regulations affecting the contract rate, with a definition of 'service area' as in section 214(e)(5). The curr_chunk outlines savings provisions related to the authority of the Commission, rights of rural telephone companies, and state authority, while also mentioning a limitation on merger review in section 5. The curr_chunk introduces an amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 regarding the deadline for making public interest determinations in mergers involving two percent carriers. The Commission must make determinations within 60 days of receiving an application, and if no action is taken within that time frame, the application is deemed approved. The amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 sets a 60-day deadline for public interest determinations in mergers involving two percent carriers. Applications not acted upon within this timeframe are deemed approved without conditions. The Commission must allow carriers to make an election regarding local exchange facilities acquired through mergers or acquisitions subject to the review deadline. The provisions apply to applications submitted after the enactment date, and pending applications are subject to the new requirements. SEC. 6. TIME LIMITS FOR ACTION ON PETITIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION OR WAIVER. Amendment to Section 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 requires the Commission to issue an order granting or denying petitions for reconsideration or waiver within 90 days. Failure to act within this period results in relief being granted or enforcement of a rule being stayed. The provisions of this section require the Commission to issue an order granting or denying petitions for reconsideration or waiver within 90 days. Any order issued shall be final and may be appealed. This applies to petitions submitted on or after the date of enactment, with pending petitions subject to these requirements. SEC. 7. NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EXCEPTIONS.\n\nExceptions to the 60-day and 90-day time periods for petitions or applications under sections 310 and 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 if national security, law enforcement, or public safety concerns are raised by Executive Branch agencies like the Department of Defense or Department of Justice."
