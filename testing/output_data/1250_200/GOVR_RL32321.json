    "content": "After years of experience in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations, analysts emphasize the importance of establishing a secure environment for sustainable peace. Military forces are crucial for initial security, but civilian police (CivPol) are increasingly recognized as more suitable for law and order tasks. Members of Congress are exploring tools for effective security in unstable regions like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Haiti. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recognizes the importance of United Nations peacekeeping operations in promoting stability in post-conflict situations. Policymakers are addressing issues with the use of civilian police (CivPol) and considering improvements to the existing system and building new U.S. and international CivPol capabilities. Proposals include facilitating recruitment and deployment of qualified personnel and ensuring appropriate training for handling law enforcement situations. Key reform efforts include recommendations for mechanisms to enhance CivPol operations. The implementation of U.S. and U.N. reform efforts includes key documents recommending improvements to existing CivPol systems and approaches for using CivPol forces. The Clinton Administration's PDD-71 focused on law enforcement aspects of peacekeeping operations, while the UN's Brahimi Panel report addressed issues with the U.N. civilian police system. Various proposals are being considered, such as recruitment, training, and deployment of international civilian police personnel. Some reforms have been implemented, while others are still under discussion. The implementation of U.S. and U.N. reform efforts includes key documents recommending improvements to existing CivPol systems and approaches for using CivPol forces. Some reforms have been implemented, while others remain under discussion. Advocates propose creating a reserve CivPol force, diversifying international police forces, and establishing more robust civilian response mechanisms. Policymakers are considering whether these recommendations could reduce reliance on U.S. military forces in post-conflict operations. The international community has increasingly relied on CivPols for various functions in peace operations, with a fourfold increase in UNCIVPOLs between 1994 and 2000. The report discusses the evolution of international police in peacekeeping operations, current mechanisms for providing CivPols, recommendations for improvement, and options for resolving ongoing issues. It also mentions the implementation of U.S. and U.N. reform efforts to enhance CivPol systems and reduce reliance on military forces in post-conflict operations. Between 1994 and 2000, the number of international civilian police in U.N. operations increased fourfold. As of February 29, 2004, there were 4,655 international civilian police assisting in U.N. peacekeeping missions. Some analysts suggest deploying international civilian police to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Haiti. U.S. assistance for law enforcement abroad is carried out within the context of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. International civilian police forces have been used for various purposes since the late 19th century, including monitoring local forces, conducting joint patrols, training and advising, and assisting with restructuring. Assistance in post-conflict situations is provided on a case-by-case basis due to the lack of specific statutory authority. During the past decade, policing in peacekeeping and related operations has evolved through five phases, involving U.N. activities, monitoring mandates, training components, and establishing security. The international forces have been armed and granted arrest powers in some cases, while the acronym SMART summarizes their functions as Support for human rights, Monitoring, Advising, Reporting, and Training. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has gone through five phases, including the addition of training components, the development of mandates for police reform, the creation of specially constituted constabulary units, and the expansion of mandates to provide international police with executive authority. This evolution reflects the international community's growing awareness of the need for comprehensive policing in such operations. The evolution of policing in peacekeeping operations has progressed through various phases, reflecting the international community's recognition of the importance of comprehensive policing. Policymakers and analysts have identified gaps in implementing peacekeeping mandates, particularly in ensuring public security. These gaps are the focus of recent legislative proposals. The recruitment and training mechanisms in current peacekeeping systems, particularly at the United Nations, are seen as deficient. There are challenges in recruiting well-trained and professional policemen from diverse backgrounds, leading to issues like corruption and lack of necessary skills. Despite efforts to address these problems, additional training is deemed necessary to improve overall effectiveness. Despite efforts to address recruitment and training challenges in peacekeeping systems, there are still problems in recruiting personnel with all necessary skills. Analysts argue that additional training is needed to instill common policing skills and enhance collaboration. Three security gaps hinder the international community's ability to establish law and order in post-conflict situations, including the deployment gap where police forces are not deployed quickly or in sufficient numbers. The deployment of police forces in international missions has faced challenges in quickly reaching authorized numbers and deploying personnel with specialized skills. This has led to gaps in mission effectiveness, particularly in ensuring security and conducting normal policing operations. The enforcement gap highlights the inability of deployed police forces to provide the necessary security levels for effective policing in post-conflict situations. The challenges in international police missions include gaps in specialized skills needed for effective policing in post-conflict situations, such as military skills for hostile environments and investigative skills for organized crime. Additionally, there is an institution gap where indigenous law enforcement lacks personnel and resources for prosecution and punishment. The United Nations and other countries provide international police assistance through various mechanisms. As of February 29, 2004, 4,655 UNCIVPOL officers from 65 nations were serving in eight U.N. missions, with Jordan and the United States being the largest contributors. Other significant contributors include India, Germany, Turkey, Ukraine, Nepal, Malaysia, Romania, Pakistan, Argentina, Poland, and the United Kingdom. The majority of UNCIVPOL officers were serving in Kosovo. As of February 29, 2004, UNCIVPOL officers from various nations were serving in U.N. missions in Kosovo, Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Georgia, and Afghanistan. The United States, along with other countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, have provided police assistance and training in different peacekeeping operations. Various states, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Belgium, Netherlands, France, Spain, and Italy, have contributed police assistance individually. The OSCE and EU have taken the lead in specific missions, often in conjunction with U.N. missions. For example, the OSCE has provided training and support for police missions in Kosovo and other countries, while the EU has assumed responsibility for police missions in Bosnia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Member States contribute police personnel voluntarily following U.N. Security Council resolutions for peacekeeping operations. The United Nations Security Council authorizes peacekeeping operations, with Member States contributing national police forces or formed police units. The U.N. philosophy of CivPol is based on democratic community policing and human rights standards. The Department of Peacekeeping Operations provides direction for all operation components, including the police mission. The Civilian Police Division oversees policy, planning, recruitment, and deployment of civilian police personnel. The Civilian Police Division oversees recruitment, deployment, and rotation of international civilian police officers for UN peacekeeping missions. The Brahimi Panel report identified challenges in police personnel recruitment and deployment, recommending actions to enhance the UN's capacity for rapid deployment of CivPols. The UNDPKO held conferences with police-contributing nations to address issues with recruitment, training, and deployment of CivPols. Donor countries reached consensus on proposals to improve U.N. policing operations, including creating a \"ready roster\" of CivPols and developing regional partnerships for joint police training. The recommendations also included incorporating CivPol personnel under the U.N. standby arrangement system and improving training measures. The UNDPKO held conferences with police-contributing nations to address issues with recruitment, training, and deployment of CivPols. Recommendations included creating a \"ready roster\" of CivPols, developing regional partnerships for joint police training, and incorporating CivPol personnel under the U.N. standby arrangement system. Some reforms have been implemented, but significant problems remain with the UNCIVPOL system. The Brahimi panel and UNDPKO seminar recommendations aimed to remedy recruitment, training, and deployment issues, with constraints on reform implementation discussed. Progress has been made in reforming the operational and internal management of UNDPKO. The Brahimi Panel recommended a doctrinal shift in UNDPKO operations, emphasizing reform and restructuring over monitoring and training activities. This shift required better-trained law enforcement personnel to work alongside rule of law experts to strengthen institutions. However, implementing this shift may strain U.N. Member States by requiring more specialized police experts. The United Nations is facing difficulties in meeting current requirements for well-trained and specialized police experts. There are concerns about the controversial approach within the U.N. CivPol system, which focuses on building local police services capacity. Despite efforts to integrate rule of law experts in peacekeeping operations, progress is viewed as \"lagging\" with limited resources available. The UNDPKO is facing challenges in recruiting civilian police with specialized skills and experience in community policing and human rights standards. The ad hoc recruitment system from various UN Member nations has resulted in uneven results and a lack of comprehensive civilian police strategy. The United Nations has faced difficulties in recruiting police officers with specialized skills and lacks a comprehensive civilian police strategy. This hinders the determination of mission needs and appropriate personnel. Current criteria for civilian police include age, years of service, language proficiency, driver's license, vehicle operation skills, and medical standards. The United Nations has struggled to recruit police officers with specialized skills and lacks a comprehensive civilian police strategy. Current criteria for civilian police include age, years of service, language proficiency, driver's license, vehicle operation skills, and medical standards. Some civilian police personnel still do not meet basic selection criteria, despite U.N. efforts to improve recruit quality. Selection Assistance Teams have been sent since 1996 to guide Member States in selecting police candidates, focusing on language, driving, and firearms requirements. Retraining and retesting of basic requirements continue in missions upon arrival. Deficiencies have led to high repatriation costs and deployment delays. The United Nations has faced challenges in recruiting specialized police officers, leading to high repatriation costs and deployment delays. Efforts to improve recruit quality include sending Selection Assistance Teams to guide Member States and retraining personnel upon arrival. Recommendations for advance recruitment of personnel have been made to enhance the quality of recruits and expedite deployment. The Brahimi Panel Report suggested establishing a national \"ready roster\" of pre-selected CivPol personnel under the U.N. System of Standby Arrangements for quick deployment. The U.N. has made progress in establishing national \"ready rosters\" of pre-selected CivPol personnel for quick deployment. Recommendations include enhancing the UNSAS with an effective ready roster of international police personnel and increasing the number of participating countries. However, a lack of individual candidates remains a major weakness according to a December 2003 evaluation. The report highlighted the need for countries to provide real candidates with professional experience for international operations, rather than just bidding for slots on on-call lists. The United Nations established an on-call list of 100 police officers and experts for advance mission planning. Training exercises have been conducted to improve the efficiency of the on-call system and recruitment for specialists has been enhanced since spring 2003. The United Nations has made efforts to improve recruitment for specialists by including substantive skills in selection criteria. Analysts have identified shortcomings in U.N. procedures, such as the lack of standardized criteria for determining the number of civilian police needed for missions. The audit criticized UNDPKO for not consistently matching skills to missions, with civilian police often performing non-policing functions. Administrative tasks accounted for a significant portion of police officers in missions, leading to training inconsistencies and inadequacies among contributing Member States. The UNDPKO audit highlighted issues with civilian police training and deployment in UNCIVPOL missions. Member States struggle to provide adequate pre-deployment training due to a lack of experienced trainers, resources, and varying national training programs. This leads to inconsistencies in skills and tasks performed by civilian police officers in missions. The UNDPKO audit identified challenges with civilian police training and deployment in UNCIVPOL missions due to inadequate pre-deployment training resources and varying national programs. Recommendations include developing regional partnerships for joint police training exercises and utilizing U.N. educational materials for rapid deployment readiness. The UNDPKO Training Unit has made efforts to improve training by distributing publications and providing resources to Member States. UNDPKO has developed common training standards for peacekeepers, including police, to ensure uniformity in competence. PDD-71 recognized the need for international organizations to supplement national training for peace operations and called for tailored training packages from the INL office when requested. The deployment of UNCIVPOL is a complex process involving mission definition, recruitment of personnel, and procurement of resources. Historically, deployment times have ranged from six to eighteen months due to resource constraints. The Brahimi Report identified reasons for deployment delays, including the lack of a standing police force. The Brahimi Panel and UNDPKO recommendations addressed deployment delays in peacekeeping missions, focusing on the lack of reserve mission leadership, unreliable standby arrangements, and insufficient equipment supply. They recommended full deployment within 30 days for traditional missions and within 90 days for complex emergencies. The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations highlighted constraints on rapid deployment, questioning the feasibility of meeting the 30-90 day timeframe for military and police personnel. The Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations identified constraints on rapid deployment, including the limited capacity of the current U.N. system to handle multiple missions concurrently, the need for region-specific expertise in civilian standby arrangements, and the requirement for contributing states to quickly deploy well-trained civilian police personnel. Reforms are underway to improve the United Nations System for Standby Arrangements (UNSAS) and develop a 100-person roster of civilian police personnel for rapid deployment. Additionally, equipment is being pre-packaged and stored at the U.N. Logistics Base in Brindisi, Italy, to enhance the procurement and management of strategic deployment stocks for peace missions. The United Nations has improved procurement and management of strategic deployment stocks at UNLB for peace missions. However, there is no program in place to prepare UNCIVPOL for rapid deployment. The U.S. CivPol program is managed by the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, recruiting civilian police personnel on a case-by-case basis through a commercial contractor. DynCorp International has been the sole supplier of civilian police personnel under a State Department contract. As of April 1, 2004, the State Department initiated a new arrangement for civilian police personnel. Three companies were contracted to maintain rosters of up to 2,000 personnel for deployment. The U.S. CivPol program is funded through various State Department bureaus and officers receive salaries ranging from $50,000-100,000, with additional allowances for those in U.N. missions. Officers participating in U.N. missions receive a base salary ranging from $50,000-100,000, along with a subsistence allowance of $75-95 per day. The total cost of U.S. CivPol personnel varies by mission, with costs ranging from $100,000 in Kosovo to $150,000-$175,000 in Iraq. Expenses in Kosovo cover salary, equipment, transportation, and MWR support, while in Iraq, it includes security, food, and housing costs. The United Nations covers these expenses in Kosovo. The cost of deploying soldiers to Iraq in 2003 ranged from $179,000 to $206,000 based on rotation schedules. U.S. CivPol personnel were participating in international missions in Kosovo, Liberia, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Israel. The deployment of six police officers to monitor high-profile prisoners in Israel is not part of an international police program. U.S. policymakers have acknowledged issues in recruiting and deploying qualified CivPol personnel, with PDD-71 aiming to enhance response capacities and improve operational activities. The policy provides guidance for recruitment, training, management, and deployment of U.S. CivPol personnel, as well as enhancing the capacity of foreign police in peace operations. Perceived problems with U.S. CivPol contingents include inefficiencies in matching skills with mission requirements, training inconsistencies, and deployment delays. Analysts stress the need for ongoing improvements in the civilian police program. The Department of State has issued contracts for a reserve cadre of up to 2,000 U.S. law enforcement personnel for international police service. The contractor is responsible for recruitment, training, and procurement services to facilitate rapid deployment of qualified CivPols. This new cadre aims to eliminate the need for recruitment and training activities for each international CivPol operation. The U.S. contributes police to an international CivPol operation. The State Department's decision to award contracts for the new CivPol cadre program to multiple companies has raised questions about the expeditiousness of the process. Some analysts fear that advantages of continued competition for CivPol deployments may be offset by additional costs and delays. The extent to which the original RFP provisions apply to the new contracts is unclear as they have not been made public. Recruitment for the United States' CivPol program involves hiring police officers from state and local law enforcement agencies, including those on leave of absence or recent retirees. However, there are concerns about the quality of recruits due to the strain on municipal and state police forces caused by military reserve call-ups for homeland security and overseas missions. The United States faces challenges in recruiting high-quality police officers for its CivPol program due to reluctance from municipal and state police departments to allow their best officers to take extended leaves. Suggestions include providing compensation to governments for detailing officers to CivPol missions and revising selection criteria to better reflect mission requirements. Candidates for CivPol missions must meet specific requirements, including U.S. citizenship, eight years of work experience with at least five years in law enforcement, a clean record, a valid driver's license, and the ability to communicate in English. Additionally, they must be in good health, pass physical and psychological tests, and be able to drive a standard transmission 4x4 vehicle. Some missions also require proficiency with a 9mm handgun. The State Department is working on recruiting specialized personnel through programs like the CivPol cadre program, aiming for nearly 55% of the cadre to be specialists. The State Department's CivPol cadre program bid solicitation indicated that 55% of the cadre would be specialists with specific qualifications. Selected individuals would receive annual training in essential policing skills to incentivize high-quality officers to join. However, the funding for training all members of the program is uncertain. The new CivPol program will maintain three separate cadre lists, potentially totaling 6,000 people. Training for U.S. CivPols is complicated by varying levels of skills among recruited police officers. The current pre-deployment training includes topics like UN operations, mission overview, human rights, and defensive tactics. Some experts find the training program insufficient. The new State Department CivPol cadre program includes training in various areas such as human rights, defensive tactics, and use of police equipment. The program aims to meet national and international policing standards, with ongoing training in policing skills. There are concerns about potential higher training costs due to increased trainees and facilities. Deployment of the U.S. CivPol contingent is also discussed. The U.S. CivPol contingent can currently deploy to a U.N. operation within 30-45 days following authorization. There are concerns about maintaining deployment capability under the new CivPol cadre system. The contractor would maintain a database of commercial sources for equipment and provide logistical support to decrease deployment time. The contractor would develop a logistics support team to provide advanced logistical and administrative support for the U.S. police contingent in international missions. Most European countries deploy police from their national forces for international CivPol operations, except for the United Kingdom and the United States. European governments have recognized the need to reform their deployment systems to improve international CivPol capabilities. The EU has developed goals and procedures since 1999 to enhance the quality and timeliness of European police missions. The European Union has developed goals and procedures since 1999 to improve the quality and timeliness of European contributions to international police missions. Member States agreed to develop a 5,000 civilian reserve police force for peace operations by 2003, within the context of the European Security and Defense Policy. The EU also established a Police Action Plan in 2001 to set common requirements for police selection, training, command, and control. The EU established the Rapid Reaction Mechanism (RRM) for civilian crisis management operations, with up to 5,000 police officers committed by Member States. They also pledged to provide rapidly deployable police units and headquarters units for missions. The EU launched its first ESDP mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina to establish sustainable policing arrangements. The EU launched a police mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a successor to the U.N. International Police Task Force. The mission aims to establish sustainable policing arrangements in accordance with best practices, consisting of 500 police officers and 70 civilian experts from 33 states. The EU also started a second police mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with 200 personnel and an annual budget of $18.6 million. Analysts are skeptical about the EU's crisis management capabilities and its ability to improve response due to concerns about national sovereignty. The EU's rapid reaction capabilities will enhance its ability to respond, but the willingness of EU Member States to surrender national sovereignty for foreign policy coordination may pose challenges. The OSCE has 160 CivPols conducting policing activities in eight countries, with a focus on training and reform. The REACT program enables the deployment of experts in conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict missions. The REACT program under the OSCE allows participating States to establish their own database of civilian experts for deployment in various security-promoting areas. Since its establishment in 2001, steps have been taken to improve the program, including creating national websites for recruitment. Many OSCE States prefer not to nominate individuals until specific field requirements are known. The OSCE developed standards for recruiting CivPols with specific skills and experience requirements. Participating States provide numerical commitments in expertise fields. The staffing matrix assists in recruiting qualified candidates. OSCE general minimum requirements for civilian police include graduation from a police training school, active police experience, English communication, negotiation skills, mapping skills, and first aid experience. Desired skills include liaison experience with NGOs and ability to operate police radio equipment.

OSCE general minimum requirements for civilian police include graduation from a police training school, active police experience, English communication, negotiation skills, mapping skills, and first aid experience. Desired skills include liaison experience with NGOs and ability to operate police radio equipment. The 108th Congress introduced bills to strengthen U.S. and international capabilities for CivPol missions and rule of law missions. These proposals aim to improve UNCIVPOL capabilities, address perceived problems with U.S. CivPol capabilities, and enhance the United States' ability to provide civilian capabilities to respond to crises abroad. H.R. 1414, the International Rule of Law and Antiterrorism Act of 2003, proposes substantial reform to make UNCIVPOL more effective and address recruitment and training issues. It calls for the establishment of a professional United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) for rapid deployment to peacekeeping missions. The bill proposes the establishment of a United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) for rapid deployment to peace operations, composed of law enforcement professionals with appropriate training and resources. It also calls for improvements in the current system and directs the Secretary of State to work with the United Nations to establish standards. The bill aims to establish a United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) to address deployment and enforcement gaps in police missions. It would create standards and training programs for international civilian police, allowing for quicker and more effective maintenance of a secure environment. This would reduce the need for combat soldiers in civilian police tasks and raise the skill levels of personnel. Opponents have concerns about the bill. The bill aims to establish a United Nations civilian police corps (UNCPC) to raise standards and skill levels of UNCIVPOL personnel. Opponents fear the establishment of a costly standing corps, concerns about funding, management capacity, and potential infringement on national sovereignty. Proponents argue that the US could veto any proposed use of the corps. H.R. 2616, the Winning the Peace Act of 2003, proposes the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve to provide security in post-conflict situations and upgrade the current ad hoc U.S. CivPol system. The reserve would serve overseas as an interim police force and train indigenous civilian police forces. Congress would call upon the President to establish a task force comprised of federal, state, and local officials. The Winning the Peace Act of 2003 proposes the establishment of a U.S. civilian police reserve to provide security in post-conflict situations. It calls for a new NATO mechanism to provide military and policing services, with selected units trained and equipped for reconstruction situations. The bill authorizes the President to commit personnel capable of providing security, including serving as a police force. The proposed legislation aims to establish a U.S. civilian police reserve to support international capabilities for post-conflict reconstruction. Proponents argue that this reserve would bridge deployment gaps and expedite the deployment of civilian police. There is debate over whether the reserve should follow a private contractor model or a new U.S. government reserve force model. Opponents of the private contractor model argue that limitations regarding commercial contractors in military operations may also apply to policing operations. They may lack dedication in unpredictable situations, unlike a government reserve force. Proponents of the government-created model believe it symbolizes U.S. commitment better, is more responsive to policy, and could be a more cohesive force than a privately-contracted one. A government reserve force is seen as a more potent symbol of U.S. commitment, responsive to policy, and potentially more cohesive than a privately-contracted force. Advocates argue that a government agency could ensure better quality recruits through stricter screening mechanisms and could draw qualified personnel from local and state police departments. Pre-deployment training and coordination with military forces could make a government-sponsored reserve force more effective and reliable than the current ad hoc model. The NATO constabulary capability could bridge the enforcement gap by providing necessary skills in post-conflict situations. However, some question if NATO is the right venue for a force with policing functions, as it may send inappropriate signals and duplicate existing structures. Analysts suggest additional provisions on equipment, training, and coordination with the military in the bill. Some analysts argue for additional provisions in the bill on equipment, training, and coordination with the military to avoid delays in deployment and ensure standardized training for police reserves. Critics question the need for such forces and the commitment of U.S. police officers, fearing it may strain existing resources and create tensions with local governments. S. 2127, the Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004, aims to strengthen civilian foreign affairs agencies' capacity to respond to overseas crises by creating a Response Readiness Corps and Reserve. This bill would allocate $80 million to hire personnel and train them for post-conflict and complex emergencies within three years of enactment. The Stabilization and Reconstruction Civilian Management Act of 2004 proposes training 10% of State Department and USAID personnel for a Stability Force. The bill aims to improve training and professionalization of CivPol personnel to bridge deployment gaps in police missions. Training adjustments in the field have been made on a case-by-case basis in places like Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor. PDD-71 proposed maintaining capacity for tailored training packages for CivPol, with some analysts recommending increased funding for police training. The State Department's proposal included provision for U.S. training of foreign police personnel, pending decisions on program details and funding availability. Another option suggested by analysts is to increase international capability for constabulary forces. Increase International Capability for Constabulary Forces by strengthening existing capabilities in some nations and creating new ones in others. Constabulary police perform tasks requiring less force than combat but more than routine law enforcement, such as regulating movements for safety, intervening in civil violence, and dispersing public disturbances. They are trained in military and policing skills, making them essential for various hostile situations. Constabulary forces, armed and trained in military and policing skills, are essential for hostile situations in post-conflict areas. They deploy rapidly as formed units and are equipped with communication and logistical support on peacekeeping missions. Specialized paramilitary units in some countries, like the Italian carabinieri and French gendarmerie, are considered ideal for constabulary tasks in peacekeeping operations. The need for constabulary forces in peacekeeping operations is highlighted, with concerns raised about the strain on resources when deployed to multiple missions. Suggestions have been made for the U.S. army to develop its own constabulary force to support military police in peacekeeping efforts. Army leaders have been hesitant to restructure for peacekeeping, but with interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, questions arise about achieving lasting peace after war. Many analysts question if military forces can truly win a war without establishing conditions for lasting peace. Proponents argue for adaptable constabulary forces to handle security tasks in various conflict environments, reducing reliance on combat soldiers for policing activities. However, uncertainty remains about other countries augmenting their constabulary capabilities for peace operations. Some analysts suggest developing a \"U.S. Force for Stability\" to address the gap in peace operations by deploying law enforcement and rule of law personnel rapidly. The United States currently deploys personnel with justice and corrections experience through Department of Justice contracts. The State Department's CivPol program aims to create a capability to deploy such personnel, but some analysts believe the current system is inadequate. Robert S. Perito, a special advisor at the USIP, advocates for a \"U.S. Force for Stability\" integrating military and civilian personnel to address post-conflict security gaps. The proposed force would consist of robust military forces, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and rule of law professionals. Perito's model proposes the deployment of robust military forces, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and rule of law professionals concurrently to provide security and bridge deployment gaps. Military shifts to perimeter security post major combat, constabulary units handle internal security, civilian police maintain public safety, and justice experts ensure the rule of law is restored. Perito's model suggests deploying military forces, civilian constabulary units, civilian police, and justice experts to maintain public safety and restore the rule of law. Recommendations from recent reports include the concurrent deployment of civilian personnel with combat forces and the creation of a standing interagency stabilization and reconstruction team. The Center for Strategic and International Studies recommends establishing an Agency for Stability Operations to oversee the deployment of a Civilian Stability Operations Corps and Reserve. This \"stability force\" model aims to deploy rule of law personnel early on to enhance long-term stability and democracy in intervened or post-conflict countries. However, implementing such a force would require changes in current U.S. practices. The proposed stability force model suggests creating a new federal agency to provide constabulary and police personnel for early deployment in crisis countries. This would require significant changes in current U.S. practices, including recruiting military police and officers as temporary federal employees instead of through contractors. The restructuring of military forces and the debate between government-employment versus government-contracted models for deployments are discussed, highlighting potential controversies. The proposed stability force model suggests creating a new federal agency to provide constabulary and police personnel for early deployment in crisis countries. The ease of deployment will depend on the method used to recruit and hire personnel, with the availability of personnel for rapid deployment depending on the arrangements under which they are recruited.

The curr_chunk provides sources for information on peacekeeping operations, including websites for the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the EU Police, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. It also references various publications on policing in peace operations. Note: This chart excludes U.N. civilian police missions with fewer than 100 personnel. The dispatch of international police units to advise and train local forces dates back to the late 1800s. The first use of U.N. civilian police in peacekeeping was in the Congo in 1960. Subsequent missions included administering West New Guinea and the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus since 1964. The U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) was the first operation to use UNCIVPOL, a multilateral U.N. police force, to assist local police in maintaining order and security. Post-cold war operations in Namibia and Western Sahara focused on monitoring local police performance. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia monitored the electoral process for independence. The United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia was established to monitor the electoral process for independence. UN Civilian Police (UNCIVPOL) monitors assisted by patrolling separately from local police and investigating complaints. UNTAG set the model for future missions by accompanying local police, investigating public complaints, and supervising police investigations. Other monitoring missions in Angola and Cambodia faced more challenging situations with less established institutions. In Angola and Cambodia, UN peacekeeping missions faced difficult situations with limited mandates. Additional functions were occasionally deemed necessary by field actors. The U.N. Protection Force deployed police monitors to new states created by the break-up of Yugoslavia, but their missions were overwhelmed by armed conflict due to inadequate mandates and insufficient forces. The U.N. Transition Administration in Cambodia (UNTAC) had a strictly monitoring mandate, leading to a significant shift of responsibilities in the field. The UNTAC police mission in Cambodia underwent a significant shift in responsibilities, with a focus on investigating violations of political liberties and human rights. The U.N. Secretary-General's representative granted arrest powers to CivPols in January 1993, but deployment delays hindered the operation's effectiveness. The insufficient number of authorized police led to adjustments in the mission's scope. The UNTAC police mission in Cambodia initially focused on ensuring law and order but later shifted to monitoring elections due to a lack of authorized police. Training for Cambodian police and judiciary was recognized as necessary, leading to the concept of deploying integrated \"justice packages\" to promote justice in the absence of an independent judicial system. The UN Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) implemented radical police reform and training components to establish civilian control over internal security forces after the country's civil war ended in 1992. The mission focused on dismantling military-controlled security forces and creating a new National Civilian Police force (PNC) with international support. The UN Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) oversaw the creation of a new National Civilian Police force (PNC) with international support, including training and assistance from various countries. The establishment of a new police force in El Salvador under the UN Observer Mission was considered a success, despite encountering significant problems. This success convinced contributing governments of the importance of civilian police deployment in peacekeeping operations. Subsequent missions in countries like Mozambique also included training and reform mandates for civilian police forces. In Mozambique, ONUMOZ began in December 1992 with a civilian police mission focused on monitoring and providing technical support to the Mozambican police. ONUMOZ was a precursor to later training and police reform missions, although it did not conduct training itself. International support for police reform continued after UN operations, primarily through bilateral training programs. Training was also a key part of the mandate for the U.N. Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR). In Somalia and Haiti, international forces led by the U.S. initiated training and reform efforts. In Somalia, the U.S.-led United Task Force (UNITAF) began efforts to provide humanitarian assistance and restore order after the collapse of Siad Barre's dictatorship. The interim Auxiliary Security Force (ASF) was established to enforce local laws and be controlled by the community, serving as a community police force in 17 cities and towns to reduce friction with the local population and minimize casualties. The United Task Force (UNITAF) in Somalia established the Auxiliary Security Force (ASF) to act as a community police force, reduce friction with the local population, and minimize casualties. UNITAF, the United Nations, and individual nations provided substantial assistance to the ASF, including salaries, equipment, uniforms, and vehicles. The ASF in Somalia was supported by UNITAF, the United Nations, and other nations with equipment, training, and food rations. UNOSOM II took over from UNITAF in May 1993, aiming to re-establish a 10,000 member Somali police force by the end of 1994. However, challenges arose due to inadequate staffing and funding, delaying the arrival of UNCIVPOL members. The UNCIVPOL members faced delays in arriving and reaching full strength due to inadequate staffing and funding. Training and cultural differences among them hindered the development of a coherent program. Despite efforts by UNOSOM II and ICITAP to provide police training, programs collapsed amid escalating violence and insecurity. ICITAP withdrew in June 1994, and UNCIVPOLs left in March 1995 with the forced U.N. withdrawal. The UNITAF ASF achieved some success in providing police forces protection, attributed to UNITAF's commitment to back it up during uncontrollable violence. The success of UNITAF in providing police forces protection was attributed to their commitment to back it up during uncontrollable violence. The need for development and reform of police institutions was recognized by the end of the 1990s. The Brahimi Panel Report recommended a shift in the use of civilian personnel in peace operations to focus on building local police capacity. The lack of commitment to support UNCIVPOLs in UNOSOM II led to the concept of an \"enforcement gap\" in maintaining law and order in post-conflict situations. In post-conflict situations, organized violent challenges may require military force to maintain law and order. The Somalia and Haiti operations highlighted problems with international civilian police forces, including the need for effective cease-fires, diverse experiences hindering training efforts, and institutional gaps undermining long-term reform. The lack of political settlement and adequate courts and prison systems can also impede successful police reform efforts. Reform efforts in Haiti began under the U.S.-led Multilateral Force (MFN) in 1994, with the International Police Monitoring Force (IPM) formed to train a new Haitian national police force. The subsequent UN Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) took over monitoring and training functions, with three follow-on missions sent over the next five years to professionalize the Haitian police. Coordination between military and civilian police was noted for establishing and maintaining public security during this process. The U.S.-led Multilateral Force (MFN) in Haiti established public security by training the Haitian national police force. The MFN adjusted rules of engagement to allow military forces to detain and shoot criminals. The transition to the UN Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) was smooth, with military forces bridging the law enforcement gap and providing backup to civilian police. UNMIH also assisted with training and technical support for the police stations. UNMIH in Haiti provided rapid backup to civilian police, contributed to stability through military patrols, and monitored HNP performance. Despite efforts to compensate for deployment gaps, institutional issues like overcrowded prisons hindered public security establishment. In Bosnia, the UN created Special Constabulary Units from 1995-1999 to assist with international police training and monitoring under the Dayton Accords. The United Nations was assigned a key role in Bosnia under the Dayton Accords to oversee a joint government and end the conflict. This was carried out through the International Police Task Force (IPTF) as part of the UN Mission to Bosnia and Hercegovina (UNMIBH). The UN's responsibilities included monitoring law enforcement activities, advising and training personnel, assessing threats to public order, and advising on organizing effective civilian law enforcement agencies. In January 2003, the European Union took over this responsibility. The European Union took over monitoring and training police in Bosnia in January 2003 through the EU Police Mission (EUPM). The 1,721 unarmed IPTF CivPols were deemed inadequate to maintain public order among hostile groups. Concerns about their effectiveness were raised during the Dayton negotiations. IFOR provided assistance in early 1996 during a test for both IPTF and IFOR in Sarajevo. In early 1996, IFOR provided assistance to the IPTF during a relocation operation, with civil affairs police specialists helping to plan. Despite only one death during the process, the lack of enforcement authority led to dwellings being gutted, burned, and booby-trapped. This resulted in a flight of Bosnian Serbs from Sarajevo suburbs, leading to a perception of U.N. failure and a loss of credibility for the understaffed and under-resourced IPTF. In late 1996, the NATO Stabilization Force (SFOR) replaced IFOR in Bosnia to provide backup for the understaffed and under-resourced IPTF. Specialized paramilitary units from foreign nations were integrated into the IPTF to fill the enforcement gap and handle hostile groups. In the late 1990s, specialized police units were recognized for filling the gap between military capabilities and unarmed police monitors. The Multinational Specialized Unit (MSU) was formed in Bosnia in 1998 to protect officials and maintain public order. This success led to the formation of similar units in Kosovo and East Timor. Additionally, in 1999, international civilian police in Kosovo and East Timor were granted executive authority powers, including the ability to carry arms and make arrests. After the coalition air war against Serbia, NATO and the United Nations took responsibility for stabilizing Kosovo and providing security through KFOR and UNMIK. In East Timor, UNTAET provided civil administration as the region transitioned to independence from Indonesia. Indonesia withdrew its security forces, leading to a complete change in governance. After Indonesia's withdrawal from East Timor, a security vacuum was filled by U.N. forces and an Australian-led peacekeeping force. The mandate for executive authority in such situations is seen as problematic due to limited international civilian police personnel available for deployment. Case-by-case decisions are made regarding the need for executive authority when local police forces are deemed unsuitable. Practitioners and policymakers must carefully vet forces before deciding on executive policing. Sovereignty considerations are crucial in making case-by-case decisions."
