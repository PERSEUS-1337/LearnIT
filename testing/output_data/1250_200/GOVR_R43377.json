    "content": "The Central African Republic (CAR) has faced conflict and state collapse since 2013 when the Seleka rebel movement took control. Anti-balaka militias formed in response, leading to widespread violence. Despite a decrease in violence since 2013-2014, periodic flare-ups continue to disrupt social cohesion and government stability. Faustin Archange Touad\u00e9ra was elected president in 2016, marking CAR's second democratic transfer of power since independence from France in 1960. The inauguration of Faustin Archange Touad\u00e9ra as president marked CAR's second democratic transfer of power since independence from France in 1960. Donors are supporting the new government while addressing policy concerns and global demands for humanitarian and peacekeeping resources. International forces, including MINUSCA and Operation Sangaris, have been deployed since 2013 to stabilize the country. France deployed Operation Sangaris in late 2013 to disarm militias and secure Bangui, CAR. The mission ended in October 2016, but France plans to maintain a rapid-reaction force. The EU also deployed soldiers to help secure Bangui in 2014-2015. CAR remains fragile, with state institutions absent in much of the country. The minority Muslim community has fled, and the Seleka movement has split into factions. The LRA, a brutal Ugandan-led militia, is active in the east. Domestic opposition to MINUSCA has been fueled by its perceived shortcomings. The Ugandan-led militia, active in the east of CAR, has benefitted from the country's recent instability. Opposition to MINUSCA has grown due to capacity issues, scandals, and political interference. Hundreds of thousands of Central Africans are refugees or internally displaced, worsening the already dire humanitarian situation. Economic activity has slightly improved since 2015, but violence continues to threaten progress. CAR was already one of the world's poorest countries before the conflict, ranking low on the U.N. Human Development Index. International policymakers are considering responses to the crisis in CAR. International policymakers are currently considering questions regarding the response to the crisis in CAR, including transitioning from emergency humanitarian assistance to development aid, funding DDR for former combatants, preparing for rebel assaults on Bangui, and lifting the U.N. arms embargo on the CAR military. The role of U.S. military advisors in countering the LRA is also being discussed. The current discussion involves questions on human rights vetting, working with the FACA, expanding targeted sanctions, adjusting MINUSCA's mandate, improving MINUSCA's effectiveness, preventing sexual abuse by peacekeepers, supporting the Touad\u00e9ra administration, and responding to ex-Seleka leaders' efforts. The conflict in CAR involves questions on human rights vetting, working with the FACA, targeted sanctions, MINUSCA's mandate, effectiveness, preventing sexual abuse, supporting the Touad\u00e9ra administration, and responding to ex-Seleka leaders' efforts. The CAR government and international partners face challenges in responding to ex-Seleka leaders, encouraging displaced populations' return, building up civilian security forces, supporting reconciliation measures, and new Kimberley Process designations for diamond exports. The conflict reflects tensions over resources, trade, and national identity in a country with a diverse religious population. The Seleka rebellion, founded in 2012 in northeastern CAR, remains strong in Muslim communities with ties to Chad and Sudan. The movement stemmed from grievances of political exclusion and abuse under Christian-led administrations. Anti-balaka groups, formed in response to Seleka, draw on anger towards historic Muslim raids and frustrations with Muslim traders. The conflict in CAR reflects tensions over resources, trade, and national identity. The conflict in the Central African Republic (CAR) has been fueled by political and religious tensions. Former President Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, who had ties to an evangelical church, supported anti-balaka mobilization. This led to brutal collective punishment based on sectarian identity, with attacks on Christian and Muslim communities. After the Seleka rebellion and national military disbandment, anti-balaka groups targeted Muslim communities, leading to mass displacement and destruction of Muslim-owned properties. The conflict in the Central African Republic (CAR) led to the displacement and persecution of Muslims, with their properties looted and mosques destroyed. Anti-balaka groups were responsible for ethnic cleansing, forcing thousands of Muslims to flee to the northeast or neighboring countries. Despite a decrease in sectarian killings since 2014, sporadic violence continues, sometimes orchestrated by militia leaders with political ties. In 2015, violence erupted following the murder of a Muslim man in Bangui, leading to an attempted overthrow of the transitional government by ex-Seleka and anti-balaka hardliners. The murder of a Muslim man in Bangui was used as cover for an attempted overthrow of the transitional government by an \"alliance of convenience\" among ex-Seleka and anti-balaka hardliners. The national military (FACA) reportedly participated in the abuses, with clashes among ex-Seleka factions increasing since 2014. The violence in CAR is rooted in a history of coopting rebel leaders into government posts, leading to cycles of rebellion and weakening civilian-led movements. Analysts suggest that these practices are linked to systems of patronage and nepotism, allowing leaders to maintain extended personal rule over the country. The recent conflict in CAR is linked to systems of patronage and nepotism, making it difficult to distinguish between combatants and civilians. The violence has calcified ethno-religious identities, leading to armed communities divided along religious lines. Anti-Muslim sentiment remains widespread among Christians, with acts of aggression targeting Muslim internally displaced persons documented in 2016. President Touad\u00e9ra assumed office in March 2016 after winning the election with over 60% of the vote. The polls were deemed transparent by African Union observers, with high voter turnout. Touad\u00e9ra, a former Prime Minister and math professor, ran as an independent candidate and was not initially seen as a front-runner. His victory has been attributed to his relative obscurity, allowing him to avoid strong opposition. President Touad\u00e9ra's victory in the election was attributed to his relative obscurity, which helped him avoid strong opposition. Despite garnering praise for his personal style and political coalition, his administration may face challenges ahead. The competition between Touad\u00e9ra and Dologu\u00e9l\u00e9 involved supporters of the former president, who was barred from running for reelection due to sanctions. Dologu\u00e9l\u00e9 was endorsed by Boziz\u00e9's party and anti-balaka militias, but faced allegations of \"massive fraud.\" Dologu\u00e9l\u00e9 conceded the election due to \"massive fraud\" but was elected to parliament as opposition leader. Touad\u00e9ra's ties to former President Boziz\u00e9 raise concerns, with Boziz\u00e9 allies in his cabinet. Under-representation of Muslims in government could fuel tensions. Touad\u00e9ra must address disarmament, reconciliation, military reform, and job creation to maintain popular support. Touad\u00e9ra faces challenges in national reconciliation, military reform, and job creation to maintain popular support. The legacy of poor governance, corruption, and instability in CAR needs to be addressed. Talks with armed group leaders and the Bangui Forum have produced frameworks for reforms, but implementation remains uncertain. Spoilers pose a threat as ex-Seleka and anti-balaka factions remain active. Anti-balaka leaders criticize Touad\u00e9ra's leadership, while some ex-Seleka leaders engage in violence against the U.N. Some armed factions reject negotiations, a fractious parliament complicates decision-making. Experts doubt government's capacity for progress. Constitutional referendum in 2015 marred by violence, new constitution aims to limit presidential power and improve oversight. The U.N Security Council authorized the U.N. Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in CAR (MINUSCA) in 2014, replacing an existing African Union force. Resolutions increased troop levels, but logistical challenges have hindered effectiveness in remote areas. MINUSCA faces challenges in CAR due to lack of national transportation infrastructure, troop equipment shortfalls, and the long rainy season. Air transport to eastern and northern zones is limited by strong winds, dust, and poorly refurbished airstrips. Despite declaring weapons-free zones in conflict-affected areas, armed actors still enter unobstructed. Force protection is a challenge, with twelve peacekeepers killed in malicious acts. An incident in Kaga-Bandoro triggered violence, claiming nearly 40 lives and displacing thousands. Continued violence in CAR has led to rising discontent with MINUSCA, with twelve peacekeepers killed in malicious acts. Public hostility towards the mission may also be fueled by demagogic rhetoric. Anti-U.N. protests in Bangui turned violent, resulting in clashes and casualties. Allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation have been made against French, AU, and U.N. troops, with MINUSCA having the highest number of allegations per year. MINUSCA has faced the highest number of sexual abuse allegations per year among U.N. peacekeeping operations since 2015. New claims in 2016 implicated French forces and MINUSCA peacekeepers in additional cases. Some allegations were suggested to be fabricated for financial compensation. The high number of abuses by MINUSCA personnel has been attributed to inadequate training and vetting of African Union troops turned U.N. personnel. The U.N. has been criticized for its insufficient response to allegations and handling of abuse cases involving foreign troops in CAR. In mid-2015, evidence of abuses by French forces in CAR was ignored by U.N. officials for months, leading to accusations of a gross institutional failure. The head of MINUSCA was fired in response, and his successor vowed to address abuses by providing resources for reporting, bolstering investigative officers, and protecting whistleblowers. The Secretary General also announced increased measures to promote transparent reporting, expand prevention efforts, and strengthen accountability for troops. The Secretary General has announced increased measures to promote transparent reporting on abuse allegations and strengthen accountability for troops in CAR, one of the world's least developed countries with a disrupted economy and widespread food insecurity. Illicit economic networks thrive, with armed groups profiting from taxation, illicit trade in gold and diamonds, and violence against civilians. Armed groups in CAR use violence, attacks, and threats to collect revenue from civilians, businesses, and public institutions, including through poaching of elephant ivory. The country's diamond exports were suspended in 2013 under the Kimberley Process due to armed groups' control of mining sites and smuggling activities. In July 2015, the Kimberley Process established a framework for the resumption of rough diamond exports from compliant zones. In March 2016, Kimberley Process monitors certified certain sub-prefectures in CAR as compliant for rough diamond exports, with exports resuming in June. Additional zones were declared compliant in September 2016, with efforts ongoing to certify more areas. However, concerns remain about premature certification in areas with active armed groups. The IMF approved a financial assistance package in 2016 to promote macroeconomic stability and inclusive growth in CAR. The IMF approved a financial assistance package in 2016 to promote macroeconomic stability and inclusive growth in CAR. An early assessment of the program concluded that structural reforms focused on revenue generation were \"broadly on track.\" The IMF lowered its GDP growth projections for CAR to 4.5% and 5.0% in 2016 and 2017, respectively, citing deteriorating security conditions. The World Bank has committed nearly $100 million in grants and concessional loans since 2013 to help restore key government services in CAR. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has operated in CAR's southeast since at least 2008, expanding its area of influence into northeastern Haute-Kotto prefecture since 2014. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), of Ugandan origin and led by Joseph Kony, has been operating in CAR's southeast since 2008. The group has expanded into northeastern Haute-Kotto prefecture since 2014, with primary operations along CAR's southeastern border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. LRA attacks have displaced hundreds of thousands in CAR, DRC, and South Sudan. The group exploits CAR's borders to smuggle ivory to Kafia Kingi for trafficking to Asia. Ugandan military, supported by the US, has conducted counter-LRA operations in CAR since 2009. The United States has provided funding for assistance to communities in LRA-affected areas, including humanitarian aid, early warning efforts, and reconciliation programs. Uganda began pulling back from its forward operating bases in CAR in 2016 and announced intentions to fully withdraw its troops by early 2017. LRA fighters have taken advantage of instability in CAR to evade regional military operations and have leveraged relationships with ex-Seleka fighters for illicit trafficking of gold and diamonds. Dominic Ongwen, a top LRA commander, surrendered to U.S. forces in CAR in January 2015. In January 2015, Dominic Ongwen, a top LRA commander, surrendered to U.S. forces in CAR and was delivered to the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Another top LRA commander, Okot Odhiambo, was confirmed dead in April 2015. Recent developments suggest a weakening of the LRA's leadership structure, with only Joseph Kony remaining at large. The LRA's total strength is estimated to be fewer than 200 fighters, but concerns remain about a potential rebound. U.S. engagement in CAR has historically been limited, with a small embassy staff and military advisors supporting Ugandan-led counter-LRA operations. In 2011, U.S. military advisors deployed to CAR to support Ugandan-led counter-LRA operations. U.S. diplomatic personnel were evacuated in 2012 as the Seleka rebel movement advanced. Limited diplomatic operations resumed in 2014, with a new Ambassador in 2015. The Obama Administration increased aid and diplomatic efforts in 2013, issuing targeted sanctions and providing support to peacekeepers. The Obama Administration increased aid and diplomatic efforts in CAR in 2013, supporting conflict mitigation, reconciliation, and governance programs. U.S. officials imposed targeted sanctions on individuals, companies, and armed groups contributing to the conflict in CAR. U.S. Permanent Representative to the U.N. Samantha Power emphasized the importance of timely response to mass violence during a visit to Bangui in 2014. The United States imposed sanctions on individuals and groups involved in the conflict in the Central African Republic, including former presidents, militia leaders, the Lord's Resistance Army, and diamond companies. Despite being on the U.N. sanctions list, some individuals are not designated by the U.N. committee. The U.S. has been a major humanitarian donor to CAR since 2013, providing over $404 million in aid. The U.S. is also the top financial contributor to MINUSCA's budget. The U.S. is a major contributor to MINUSCA's budget through assessed contributions. Funding for MINUSCA is provided through the State Department's CIPA account. The U.S. allocated $286.7 million in FY2016 and requested $285 million for FY2017. Additionally, the State Department requested $18.1 million in bilateral aid for CAR in FY2017 for various programs including peacekeeping operations, security sector reform, and peacebuilding. At a donors' conference in 2016, the U.S. pledged $11.7 million to support the justice sector in CAR. The U.S. pledged $11.7 million in funding for the justice sector, law enforcement, and economic livelihoods in CAR at a donors' conference in 2016. Total donor pledges reached $2.2 billion, with additional funding allocated for development and peacebuilding programs in CAR between FY2013 and FY2016. The State Department-administered INCLE account has been a top source of U.S. aid funding for CAR since 2014, with at least $25 million notified to Congress in FY2015 alone for building, training, and equipping CAR's police and judicial sectors. President Obama waived legal restrictions on certain aid to the government of CAR under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 due to CAR's poor ranking in the State Department's Trafficking in Persons report. The 114th Congress shaped U.S. engagement with CAR through legislative provisions, including funding for reconciliation, peacebuilding programs, and assistance for civilians affected by the LRA. Similar provisions were included in the House version of the FY2017 foreign aid appropriations bill. The 114th Congress shaped U.S. engagement with CAR through legislative provisions, including funding for reconciliation, peacebuilding programs, and assistance for civilians affected by the LRA. Relevant legislation enacted included the Eliminate, Neutralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016. Resolutions introduced in Congress addressed issues such as genocide, mass atrocities, the Lord's Resistance Army, and World Refugee Day. Senate appropriators expressed concern about violence between Christians in CAR. In the 113th Congress, Senate appropriators expressed concern about violence between Christians and Muslims in CAR, leading to a resolution passed concerning the crisis in CAR. The State Department submitted a strategy document in April 2015 outlining U.S. national interests in CAR, including preventing mass atrocities and helping CAR become a stable regional partner. Despite international efforts, residents of CAR continue to suffer armed attacks by militias, highlighting the challenges in protecting civilians. Despite international efforts and commitments to protect civilians in CAR, residents continue to suffer armed attacks by militias. Congress may influence funding levels and support for stabilization efforts, weighing the relative priority of the CAR crisis among competing priorities in Africa m and beyond. The debate between African Union and U.N.-conducted stabilization missions is ongoing, with neighboring states showing more political commitment but facing capacity and political challenges. U.N. peacekeeping operations, while well-funded, can be slow to deploy and risk-averse, potentially inhibiting effectiveness. The U.N. peacekeeping operations in CAR are well-funded but slow to deploy and risk-averse, hindering their effectiveness. Despite various international interventions and efforts, stability and governance in CAR remain elusive. The conflict has led to harmful dynamics at the grassroots level, with concerns about its impact on regional stability. The CAR crisis may have a lasting impact on regional stability, especially with conflicts in neighboring countries like South Sudan, Burundi, and DRC ongoing. Despite little reported violence among border communities, CAR refugees strain local resources and hinder trade and aid delivery. Neighboring states have limited capacity to address these issues, potentially leading to further instability. The decision not to renew the Burundian police contingent in MINUSCA due to abuses in Burundi could further complicate stabilization efforts. The CAR crisis could lead to the withdrawal of military personnel and concerns about extremist organizations seeking safe havens in the country."
