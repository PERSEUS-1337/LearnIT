    "content": "The child nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program, provide food to children in institutional settings. Other programs like the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program and Special Milk Program support healthy eating in schools. These programs were last reauthorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. Despite some authorities expiring in 2015, funding from annual appropriations acts has allowed the programs to continue operating. In the 114th Congress, lawmakers began child nutrition reauthorization but did not complete it. Reauthorization involves potentially changing permanent statutes related to child nutrition programs. Legislation (S. 3136 and H.R. 5003) died at the end of the Congress. There were no significant reauthorization efforts in the 115th Congress, but the 2018 farm bill included some provisions for child nutrition programs. The final enacted bill included provisions related to child nutrition programs, raising issues for future reauthorization efforts. These issues include the nutritional quality of foods served in schools, access to meals, and stakeholders involved in the child nutrition programs. The report provides an overview of current issues in child nutrition programs, focusing on key topics raised during the 114th Congress and 2018 farm bill negotiations. The report provides a high-level review of recent issues in child nutrition programs, referencing legislative proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses. It highlights the importance of meeting nutritional requirements for federal reimbursement in school meals. The nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods were updated following the enactment of the HHFKA, with USDA required to issue proposed regulations within specific timeframes. The law also provided increased federal subsidies for schools meeting the new requirements and funding for technical assistance. The standards were championed by various organizations and stakeholders, and the final rules were published by USDA-FNS in 2012 and 2016. The final rule for school meals and competitive foods, based on the HHFKA, implemented nutrition standards aligned with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and recommendations from the Institute of Medicine. The standards increased fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in meals, limited calories, sodium, and fats, and restricted milk to low-fat options. Senior high school students were required to choose a half-serving of fruits or vegetables with meals. Competitive foods were also subject to calorie, sodium, and fat limits, with exceptions for fundraisers. The standards phased in during school year 2012-2013. The meal standards began phasing in during school year 2012-2013, with some schools facing challenges in implementing the changes such as difficulty obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products, issues with student acceptance of foods, reduced participation, increased costs, and food waste. The School Nutrition Association (SNA) shared accounts of these challenges, while studies by the U.S. Government Accountability Office and USDA confirmed the issues in the first two years of implementation. SNA advocated for changes to the standards, while others argued for maintaining them for children's health. In January 2014, USDA removed weekly limits on grains and protein. Congress enacted provisions in FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017 that loosened milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements. USDA made similar changes for SY2018-2019. In December 2018, USDA published a final rule indefinitely changing aspects of the standards starting in SY2019-2020, allowing flavored, low-fat milk and 50% whole grain-rich requirement. Target 1 sodium limits are maintained from SY2019-2020 through SY2023-2024. Target 2 limits start in SY2024-2025, eliminating Target 3 limits. The nutrition standards for school meals have been modified over time, with changes to milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements. Legislation in the 115th Congress proposed revisions to ensure standards are based on research, do not add costs, and maintain healthy meals. Child nutrition reauthorization proposals in the 114th Congress aimed to alter school meal standards, with the House proposing USDA reviews every three years and allowing fundraisers to bypass competitive food standards. The Senate proposed revising whole grain and sodium requirements within 90 days of enactment. Negotiations between Senate committee, White House, USDA, and School Nutrition Association led to an agreement to reduce whole grain-rich requirement to 80% and delay Target 2 sodium requirement. Fresh fruit and vegetable snacks in FFVP must be in natural state without additives. Stakeholders debate including frozen, dried, and canned options in program. 2014 farm bill funded pilot project in four states to incorporate canned, dried, and frozen fruits and vegetables in schools facing challenges with fresh produce. According to the final evaluation in 2017, 56% of pilot schools incorporated CDF fruits and vegetables during the demonstration. Schools mainly introduced dried and canned fruits, leading to decreased vegetable offerings and increased fruit offerings in the FFVP. However, there was no significant impact on students' vegetable consumption, and fruit consumption declined on FFVP snack days. Student satisfaction with FFVP slightly decreased during the pilot, while parents' responses were mixed. Legislative proposals to change FFVP offerings have been considered, but no significant changes have been enacted. In the 114th Congress, child nutrition reauthorization legislation proposed allowing schools to serve all forms of fruits and vegetables in the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP). The Senate committee's proposal included temporary exemptions for schools with limited resources to serve canned or dried fruits and vegetables. Schools participating in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) must comply with Buy American requirements to purchase domestic products whenever possible. Schools participating in the NSLP and SBP must purchase domestic commodities or products produced and processed substantially in the United States. USDA regulations and guidance outline the Buy American requirements for foods purchased with funds from the nonprofit school food service account. The guidance encourages SFAs to integrate Buy American into their procurement processes by monitoring the USDA catalog for appropriate products and including Buy American language in solicitations and contracts. SFAs can make exceptions to the Buy American requirements on a limited basis when certain criteria are met, and state agencies must review compliance and take corrective action when necessary. The 2018 farm bill includes a provision for USDA to enforce full compliance with Buy American requirements. The farm bill (Section 4207 of P.L. 115-334) requires USDA to enforce Buy American requirements within 180 days of enactment. It clarifies that domestic products must be processed in the U.S. and contain meats, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural commodities produced in the U.S. or its territories. Proponents argue for stricter requirements due to economic and food safety concerns, particularly regarding sourcing from China. Others advocate for maintaining schools' discretion in food procurement. Some policymakers advocate for stricter Buy American requirements for domestic sourcing, especially concerning food safety concerns with China. There are debates on maintaining schools' discretion in food procurement, citing the availability and cost-effectiveness of high-quality domestic options. Alternative proposals for summer meals in rural areas have been tested due to challenges in reaching children, as reported by the U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2018. The 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act allocated $85 million for demonstration projects to improve access to food for children in urban and rural areas. The Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer for Children (SEBTC) project, funded by the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act, provides electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. Participants receive $30 or $60 per month on an EBT card for SNAP or WIC. Evaluation from FY2011 to FY2013 found positive outcomes. The Summer EBT program, evaluated from FY2011 to FY2013, showed a decrease in very low food security among participants and improved consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Congress has provided funding for Summer EBT projects, with recent funding of $28 million in FY2019. Awardees for summer 2017 and 2018 included various states and nations. USDA announced a new strategy for grant recipients in FY2019. In October 2018, USDA-FNS announced a new strategy for determining grant recipients in FY2019 for the Summer EBT program. The agency will prioritize new states, statewide projects, and projects operating in summers 2019 through 2021. There were proposals in the 114th and 115th Congresses to expand Summer EBT, including funding recommendations from the Obama Administration. Funding from the 2010 Agriculture Appropriations Act was also used for other demonstration projects like the Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) in eight states from 2010 to 2012. The Enhanced Summer Food Service Program (eSFSP) ran from 2010 to 2012 in eight states, with initiatives such as lengthening operations, adding activities, meal delivery, and food backpacks. Evaluations showed increased summer meal participation rates and consistent food insecurity rates for children in certain initiatives. Another project provided exemptions from congregate feeding requirements for outdoor meal sites experiencing excessive heat since 2015. The USDA offers exemptions for outdoor meal sites experiencing excessive heat during the summer since 2015. Sites must continue serving children in congregate settings on normal days and provide take-home meals on hot days. There have been proposals in recent years to allow rural meal sites to provide offsite consumption of meals under certain conditions. The HHFKA created the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to provide free meals to students in schools with high proportions of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Participation in CEP has increased, with over 20,700 schools participating as of SY2016-2017. Supporters argue that CEP improves meal access, reduces stigma, and lowers administrative costs. Some have sought changes to the option, such as restricting schools' eligibility. In the 114th Congress, the House committee's child nutrition bill aimed to restrict schools' eligibility for the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) to target resources better. CEP has caused data issues for other federal and state programs, like the Title I-A program, due to changes in how eligibility is determined. Students may qualify for free, reduced-price, or full-price meals, leading to concerns about unpaid meal costs and schools' responses. In recent years, the issue of students owing and not paying their meal costs, and schools' responses to such situations, has received increased attention. Schools may charge unpaid meal costs, leading to debt collection efforts or \"lunch shaming\" practices like providing alternative meals or restricting participation in school events. Lunch shaming instances have been reported in news articles from different states, creating a financial burden on school meal programs. The issue of unpaid meal costs in schools has led to burden on meal programs. Schools rely on federal funds and student payments for meals. If unpaid funds cannot be recovered, schools must cover the costs with nonfederal funding sources. Congress and USDA have taken actions to address this issue since 2010, but national standards were not recommended in the 2016 report to Congress. The USDA's Report to Congress in June 2016 did not recommend national standards for unpaid meal charges. Instead, they suggested clarifying and updating policy guidance at the local level. SFAs were required to establish a written meal charge policy by July 1, 2017, with instructions on handling situations where a child does not pay for a meal. Findings from a 2014 study and a Request for Information showed that meal charge policies were mainly determined at the school and district levels, with varying levels of formality. Policies for meal charges were mainly decided at the school and district levels, with varying levels of formality and enforcement. School officials preferred local control, while national advocacy groups favored national standards. Legislative proposals in the 115th Congress addressed lunch shaming and unpaid meal costs, including the Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017. The Shaming Act of 2017 aimed to set national standards for how schools handle children unable to pay for meals. States have also passed laws addressing unpaid meal costs, such as Illinois requiring schools to serve regular meals to students who cannot pay. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) introduced requirements for schools to review and potentially increase prices of paid lunches to ensure children receiving free and reduced-price lunches get the full value of federal funds. The requirements aim to ensure that children receiving free and reduced-price lunches receive the full value of federal funds. A USDA study found that federal subsidies for free and reduced-price lunches were cross-subsidizing other aspects of the meals programs. The paid lunch equity formula mandates that the price per paid lunch must eventually match or exceed the difference between federal reimbursements for free and paid lunches. If schools do not meet this requirement, they must gradually increase the price of a paid lunch until they close the gap. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) requires schools to gradually increase the price of paid lunches if they are not charging at least $3.00 per lunch to match federal reimbursements for free lunches. Revenue from nonprogram foods must go to the school food authority-run nonprofit school food service account. USDA provided exemptions for financially stable schools for certain school years. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act requires schools to increase paid lunch prices if below $3.00 to match federal reimbursements. Exemptions were provided for financially stable schools. Legislative proposals aimed to change paid lunch equity requirements, with different approaches suggested by House and Senate committees.
