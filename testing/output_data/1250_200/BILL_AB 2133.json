The State of California prioritizes improving occupational health and safety for family child care providers to protect both providers and the children in their care from hazards.

The director is required to annually publish a list of licensed child day care facilities, excluding small family day care homes, detailing their services and licensed capacity. The department must protect the personal privacy of small family day care homes by preventing the use of lists containing names and addresses. To protect the privacy of small family day care homes, the department will restrict the use of lists containing identifying information, except for necessary licensing purposes and providing information to specific agencies and programs. The department will adopt regulations on the confidentiality of information provided on small family day care homes, ensuring referral only to licensed homes in good standing. Violators may be denied access to information and reported to appropriate departments. Section 1596.864 of the Health and Safety Code defines \"family child care provider\" as either a licensed family day care home provider or a person providing child care under a publicly funded program.

Family child care providers must attend a two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to their profession. The State Department of Social Services may establish a schedule for completion within four years or three months of becoming a provider. The training includes identifying and minimizing risks such as chemical hazards, infectious diseases, and physical hazards.

Presentations by relevant organizations are approved by the department to improve the child care system.
