Unemployment may not fall immediately when economic growth picks up after a recession due to firms having underutilized employees on their payrolls. Employers can initially increase output without hiring more workers by raising productivity. Output growth during an economic expansion depends on the growth rates of labor supply and labor productivity. During an economic expansion, output growth is determined by labor supply and productivity rates. If real GDP growth exceeds labor productivity growth, employment will increase, leading to a decrease in the unemployment rate. Economist Arthur Okun's \"Okun's law\" highlights the negative relationship between GDP growth rates and unemployment. Maintaining a stable unemployment rate requires real GDP growth to be equal to potential output growth. Potential output is the economy's capacity to produce goods and services with available resources. The rate of growth in potential output is determined by potential productivity and labor supply when the economy is at full employment. High unemployment leads to actual GDP falling short of potential GDP, creating an output gap. If GDP growth falls below labor force growth, unemployment rises. Conversely, if GDP growth exceeds labor force growth, unemployment falls as new jobs are created. The rising demand for goods and services will be met by drawing from the pool of unemployed workers, leading to a decrease in the unemployment rate. However, if GDP growth equals labor force growth without productivity growth, the share of the employed labor force will decrease, causing the unemployment rate to rise. To lower the unemployment rate in the long run, GDP growth must exceed the combined growth rates of the labor force and productivity. Policymakers need to know the rate of GDP growth to implement stimulus policies effectively. The growth rate of the labor force has slowed since 2000 due to the aging of the baby-boom generation. The labor force growth rate has slowed to 0.7% per year on average between 2010 and 2020. Productivity growth has varied over time, with rates ranging from 2.8% to 1.4% annually. Currently, productivity growth is at 1.6% annually. To lower the unemployment rate, real GDP growth above 2.5% is needed. According to Okun's law, real GDP must grow approximately 2 percentage points faster than potential GDP for a 1 percentage point decline in unemployment. The time between economic recovery and declining unemployment rates varies. The current recovery shows a slower decline in unemployment compared to previous recessions. The current recovery shows a slower decline in unemployment compared to previous recessions, with varying timeframes for the unemployment rate to begin falling and its pace of decline. The debate over the applicability of Okun's law to changes in economic growth and the unemployment rate has recently emerged. The unemployment rate fell to 9.4% despite slow GDP growth in 2011. There was a debate on Okun's law and its relation to economic growth and unemployment rate changes. The rate dropped to 8.5% in December 2011, which was faster than expected based on GDP growth. Bernanke noted the discrepancy at a conference in March 2012. Despite slow GDP growth in 2011, the unemployment rate fell to 9.4%. Bernanke noted a discrepancy in the relation between economic growth and unemployment rate changes, suggesting a temporary disconnect may have compensated for earlier deviations from Okun's law. Some studies found that Okun's law underpredicted the actual decline in the unemployment rate during recovery periods after recessions. Owyang and Sekhposyan caution against relying too heavily on back-of-the-envelope calculations to relate changes in the unemployment rate to output growth. Okun's Law, a macroeconomic relationship, is considered strong and stable despite not being as universal as the law of gravity. Ball et al found that increases and decreases in output have the same effect on unemployment, with the rule-of-thumb applying equally well to recoveries and recessions. They also noted that large output gaps persisted during jobless recoveries from the 1990-1991, 2001, and 2007-2009 recessions. According to economists Robert J. Gordon, Susanto Basu, and John G. Fernald, potential output growth is expected to slow down in the next 20 years due to diminishing gains from information technology investments. This, along with declines in labor force growth, is projected to result in a 2.4% rate of growth in potential output. The drop in household net worth during the 2007-2009 recession may lead to a larger supply of labor in the near term as workers find it harder to afford leisure time. The drop in household net worth during the recession may lead to a larger supply of labor in the near term, affecting potential output growth. Weidner and Williams found that potential output growth was faster in past recoveries compared to the Great Recession, estimating it at 2.1%. This uncertainty highlights the challenges in estimating potential output growth. The Congressional Budget Office projected that potential output growth will be 2.2% between 2012 and 2022, lower than the 3.3% growth rate between 1950 and 2011. This decrease is mainly due to reduced potential labor force growth, leading to a higher unemployment rate until 2018."
