    "content": "Congressional and consumer interest in passenger natural gas vehicles (NGVs) has increased due to higher gasoline prices, environmental concerns, and policy proposals like the \"Pickens Plan.\" Despite availability for years, NGVs are mainly used in government and private fleets, with limited consumer adoption. Larger NGVs, such as transit buses and delivery trucks, receive incentives but face high costs and infrastructure challenges. In 2009, the US had around 114,000 compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles and 3,000 liquefied natural gas (LNG) vehicles, mostly light-duty vehicles compared to 235 million conventional light-duty vehicles. In 2009, the US had around 114,000 compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles and 3,000 liquefied natural gas (LNG) vehicles, mostly light-duty vehicles. Roughly two-thirds of NGVs are light-duty vehicles, compared to roughly 235 million conventional light-duty vehicles. Only about 400 new light-duty NGVs were sold in 2009, and for MY 2012, only two passenger NGVs are available for purchase by consumers. The purchase prices for NGVs exceed those of conventional vehicles, but the difference can be made up over the vehicle's life in fuel cost savings. The cost of installing a home refueling system for natural gas vehicles (NGVs) can range from $3,400 to $4,500 plus installation. A tax credit of $1,000 was available until the end of 2011 for installing new alternative fuel refueling infrastructure. Annual fuel cost savings from switching to natural gas could be around $600. The payback period for a CNG vehicle and home refueling system is over 17 years, which may or may not be acceptable to consumers. The payback period for a CNG vehicle and home refueling system is over 17 years, which may or may not be acceptable to consumers. Factors such as fuel price differentials, tax incentives, and future vehicle prices can impact this payback period. Other benefits of NGVs include reducing petroleum dependence and lower emissions compared to gasoline vehicles. NGVs have lower emissions than gasoline vehicles, with most natural gas being domestically produced. However, NGVs have drawbacks such as lower power and acceleration, shorter range, and reduced cargo space due to larger storage tanks. These factors may impact individual purchasing decisions and overall marketability of the vehicles. From a technical feasibility standpoint, converting a vehicle to operate on natural gas involves changes to the fuel system, including a new fuel tank, fuel lines, and modifications to the electronic control unit. Converting existing vehicles to run on natural gas was previously more problematic due to EPA restrictions, but recent changes have made it more practical. NGV conversions in the United States must comply with the Clean Air Act, requiring rigorous emissions tests for new vehicles. After a vehicle has been certified by the EPA, any changes to the exhaust, engine, or fuel systems may be considered tampering under the Clean Air Act. EPA prohibits removing or rendering inoperative any device or element of design installed on a motor vehicle. Changes leading to higher pollutant emissions are considered tampering. EPA issued guidance on what constitutes tampering in terms of replacement parts under routine maintenance. In the 1990s, EPA tightened testing standards for vehicles converted to run on natural gas or LPG after data showed some were exceeding emissions standards. This decision required compliance with new testing procedures by March 2002, which could be costly for small producers due to the need for independent certification of each vehicle. In the early 2000s, certifying vehicle conversions was expensive for small producers due to the need for independent certification of each vehicle. Universal \"conversion kits\" were effectively prohibited under EPA enforcement guidance, costing up to $200,000 to design, manufacture, and certify a conversion for a single engine family. However, on April 8, 2011, EPA issued final regulations providing new flexibility for converters to certify their conversions without violating anti-tampering provisions. EPA has relaxed requirements for certifying new and relatively-new vehicles, with cost reductions expected for all three classes of vehicles. For older vehicles, less detailed testing is required, especially for the on-board diagnostic system. EPA's certification waiver of anti-tampering provisions remains in effect for one year, as long as the conversion kit is not modified. Vehicle conversions would not void the original manufacturer's warranty unless the modified systems are directly affected. Several bills have been introduced in recent years to promote NGVs and NGV infrastructure, most notably in the 112th Congress, the New Alternative Transportation to Give Americans Solutions Act (Nat Gas Act) of 2011 (H.R. 1380 and S. 1863) would provide incentives for NGVs. The bill would reinstate tax credits for NGV purchases and natural gas refueling infrastructure installation, extend credits through 2016, provide tax credits to automakers producing NGVs, and authorize grants for developing natural gas engines. Interest in NGVs has increased due to higher gasoline prices and concerns about U.S. oil dependence. The interest in natural gas vehicles (NGVs) has been growing due to higher gasoline prices and concerns about U.S. oil dependence. However, the market for NGVs is limited, with few new passenger vehicles capable of running on natural gas and limited opportunities for converting existing gasoline vehicles. To promote the expansion of NGVs, new EPA regulations on NGV conversions and incentives to decrease the price differential between natural gas and gasoline could be beneficial."
