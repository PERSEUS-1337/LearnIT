    "content": "The federal government has long supported minority and economically disadvantaged small businesses through procurement contracts and assistance programs. These initiatives, originating from the Small Business Act of 1958, aim to promote the development of disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs) by providing preferential treatment in government contract awards. The \u00a7 8(a) program, initially focused on job creation in low-income areas, shifted to minority small business development under President Nixon's executive orders. This program, established in 1978 by P.L. 95-507, aimed to assist minority businesses through federal contracting opportunities. The Small Business Administration's Section 8(a) program allows for government contracts to be subcontracted to socially disadvantaged individuals, including minorities like Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian Pacific Americans. Applicants must demonstrate social disadvantage to qualify for the program. The Small Business Administration's Section 8(a) program allows government contracts to be subcontracted to socially disadvantaged individuals, including minorities. Applicants must establish social and economic disadvantage to qualify for certification. The program includes a presumption of disadvantaged status for minority group members and excludes businesses owned by individuals not truly socially or economically disadvantaged. The Section 8(d) program requires prime contractors on federal contracts to negotiate subcontracting plans with percentage goals for small socially and economically disadvantaged firms. Failure to comply may result in liquidated damages. P.L. 95-507 mandated federal agencies to establish annual goals for awarding contracts to small disadvantaged businesses. The Business Opportunity Development Reform Act of 1988 directed federal agencies to establish annual procurement goals for small disadvantaged businesses, with a government-wide goal of at least 20% for small businesses and 5% for disadvantaged businesses. The goals aim to create maximum opportunity for small disadvantaged businesses to sell goods and services to the government, with waivers allowed in certain circumstances. Amendments in 1994 expanded the minority procurement goal to include small businesses owned by women. \"Goals and set-asides for socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, women, and minority groups have been included in federal funding measures for education, defense, and transportation over the last two decades. Congress established participation goals for small disadvantaged businesses in procurement for various agencies and enacted laws with minority business participation goals on federally funded projects.\" The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) and other federal funding measures have included minority business participation goals. Congress authorized agencies to apply a price evaluation preference to bids from businesses other than Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) to meet these goals. Litigation on racial preferences in federal contracting has been complex since the Supreme Court's decision in Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Pena. The Supreme Court's actions on the Adarand case in 2001 involved changes in legal standing, details of the federal program, and regulatory reforms on affirmative action. The Court dismissed the appeal as \"improvidently granted\" regarding the Tenth Circuit's ruling on a federal highway program promoting minority business utilization. The program was found to be constitutional after revisions in 1997. This case followed previous Supreme Court decisions on racial preferences in federal contracting. The Supreme Court's decisions in Fullilove v. Klutznick and City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co. addressed affirmative action measures for minority entrepreneurs in public contracting. The Court ruled that race-conscious remedies could be legislated in response to past discrimination, but racial balancing without specific evidence of minority exclusion was impermissible. The Adarand case in 2001 applied strict scrutiny to federal programs using racial preferences in contracting. The Adarand case in 2001 applied \"strict scrutiny\" to a federal transportation program of financial incentives for prime contractors who subcontracted to firms owned by socially and economically disadvantaged group members. The program did not set aside a specific percentage of subcontract awards for disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs) but provided incentive payments to prime contractors whose subcontracts with DBEs exceeded 10% of the total contract value. The Adarand case in 2001 involved a federal transportation program that paid prime contractors 1.5% to 2% of the contract amount if their subcontracts with disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs) exceeded 10% of the total contract value. Adarand Constructors, Inc., a white-owned construction firm, challenged the program after losing a bid to a higher bidding DBE. The program was initially upheld with lenient judicial review, but the Supreme Court later reversed the decision, rejecting the use of \"intermediate scrutiny\" for racial preferences. The Adarand case in 2001 involved a federal transportation program that paid prime contractors based on subcontracting with disadvantaged business enterprises. The Supreme Court rejected the use of \"intermediate scrutiny\" for racial preferences, requiring strict scrutiny for race-based classifications by Congress. Despite this, the Court acknowledged the need for government action to address racial discrimination. The Supreme Court in the Adarand case acknowledged the need for government action to address racial discrimination, allowing Congress to enact broad discrimination remedies based on nationwide findings. The Court required strict scrutiny for race-based classifications by Congress but did not provide clear guidance on the scope of remedial authority. The DOT incentive program failed the \"narrow tailoring\" test as it linked a race-based presumption to financial bonuses for prime contractors. The program was deemed both \"overinclusive\" and \"underinclusive.\" The Tenth Circuit in 2000 reversed the district court injunction against future implementation of DOT's disadvantaged business enterprise program in Colorado, considering its constitutionality. The court of appeals reviewed the constitutionality of the DOT's disadvantaged business enterprise program in Colorado, finding that the program, as currently structured without financial incentives, passed constitutional scrutiny. The federal government's interest in addressing past discrimination in government contracting was deemed compelling, and Congress had the authority to act in this regard. The federal government had a \"compelling interest\" in preventing and remedying past discrimination in government contracting nationwide. Congress's authority to act was not limited geographically and included evidence of public and private discrimination in the construction industry. Congressional hearings highlighted social and economic obstacles faced by minorities in business formation and competition for government contracts. The Tenth Circuit panel found that disparity studies in major cities raised an inference of discriminatory barriers in federal contracting, leading to a \"compelling\" government interest in remedying the situation. The appellate tribunal reviewed the DBE program, concluding that regulatory reforms had addressed constitutional flaws, effectively laying the old program to rest. The Tenth Circuit panel agreed that the government's regulatory reforms eliminated the old DBE program, reversing the district court's order. The appeals court clarified that the 5% and 10% goals in the program were aspirational, not mandatory, and any challenge to those provisions was outside the scope of the ruling. The revised program was found to be constitutionally superior to the pre-1996 program. The revised DOT program post-1996 was constitutionally superior to the pre-1996 program, incorporating race-neutral measures and time limits for disadvantaged businesses. It was more flexible and voluntary for prime contractors, with an express waiver option. The post-1996 revisions of the DOT program improved constitutionality by incorporating race-neutral measures, time limits for disadvantaged businesses, and voluntary participation for prime contractors with an express waiver option. Monetary caps on subsidies to prime contractors and a shift to a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard for proof of social disadvantage further mitigated the burden on third parties. The program also required an individualized showing of economic disadvantage for all applicants, minority and non-minority alike, satisfying the Croson requirement. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in an appeal from the Tenth Circuit's final decision in the Adarand case, focusing on procedural irregularities rather than the constitutional claims. Adarand Constructors, Inc. argued that the court of appeals misconceived the scope of the appeal, specifically regarding DOT regulations applicable to direct procurement of highway construction on federal lands. The court of appeals misunderstood the appeal in the Adarand case, focusing on irrelevant DOT regulations for federally assisted projects instead of direct federal procurement. The SDB program's narrow tailoring was questioned due to the suspension of race-conscious aspects in Colorado and other states. Adarand had difficulty proving unequal competition or contract losses under the revised rules. The government argued that Adarand's lawsuit was outdated, as the program it challenged no longer existed. The government argued that Adarand's lawsuit was outdated as the program it challenged no longer existed. The Supreme Court dismissed the case due to technical flaws in the appeal, as Adarand was challenging a defunct aspect of the program. The Court declined to reach the merits of the controversy, leaving two major questions unanswered. The Tenth Circuit found that Congress had a \"solid basis in evidence\" for enacting legislation to remedy past discrimination. Court rulings emphasize the need for \"congruence and proportionality\" in remedies under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Tenth Circuit found that Congress had a \"solid basis in evidence\" for enacting legislation to remedy past discrimination, emphasizing the need for \"congruence and proportionality\" in remedies under federal civil rights laws. Questions remain regarding the application of strict scrutiny analysis to \u00a7 5 race discrimination legislation and the use of \"aspirational goals\" for minority group participation in federal procurement. Some courts have questioned the coercive nature of government-required goal-setting and enforcement sanctions in affirmative action cases. For example, the Ninth Circuit invalidated a California statute that mandated subcontracting work to female- and minority-owned firms. The D.C. Circuit also found FCC regulations unlawful as they influenced hiring decisions to mirror racial demographics. The Adarand case influenced hiring decisions to reflect racial demographics, with the Court's final decision delaying a definitive review of affirmative action. Federal regulatory reforms proposed stricter requirements for minority contractors in federal procurement, suspending set-aside programs for two years. The plan suspended set-aside programs for two years, implementing statistical benchmarks for estimating disadvantaged business participation in federal contracting. Bid and evaluation credits are authorized for economically disadvantaged firms in industries below benchmarks, monitored by the Commerce Department. The system relies on outreach and technical assistance to avoid constitutional issues. The Justice Department's response to comments on its proposal, along with proposed amendments to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) in 1997, introduced benchmark limits for subcontracting opportunities for disadvantaged firms. The program interacts with various procurement mechanisms and includes evaluation factors for bids by non-minority prime contractors. The key feature is \"benchmarking\" by the Commerce Department, primarily using census data to determine the capacity and availability of minority-owned firms. DOJ also calculates the effect of discrimination on minority business development to tailor the government's use of race-conscious subcontracting. The DOJ introduced benchmark limits for subcontracting opportunities for disadvantaged firms in response to comments on its proposal. The program involves benchmarking by the Commerce Department to determine the capacity of minority-owned firms. Utilization of minority-owned firms is compared to benchmarks to assess the impact of discrimination and the need for race-conscious programs. Final regulations implementing Justice Department recommendations for the \u00a7 8(a) business development program were issued by the SBA in 1998, including a new process for certifying small disadvantaged businesses and a price evaluation adjustment program tied to benchmarks. The new process for certifying small disadvantaged businesses involves SBA or approved agencies making ownership determinations before reviewing applications for disadvantaged status. Social and economic disadvantage definitions remain intact, with minority group members enjoying a presumption of social disadvantage. Economic disadvantage criteria must be met, and third-party challenges are allowed. The revised SBA regulations ease the burden on non-minority applicants by adopting a \"preponderance of evidence\" rule for proving social and economic disadvantage. USDOT responded to Adarand Constructors by issuing revised regulations to implement minority set-aside provisions in federal transportation authorization measures, ensuring that a minimum of 10 percent of funds are allocated to small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The TEA-21 Act, extended by P.L. 109-59, mandates that funds for programs under titles I, III, and V be spent on small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The law reserves 10% of federal highway and surface transportation funds for small disadvantaged firms, with revised regulations defining disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs) based on assets and social/economic disadvantage. The regulations aim to decentralize the administration of the DBE program. The regulations decentralize the administration of the DBE program by delegating implementation to state agencies receiving federal transportation funds. A two-step process is established for states to determine the level of DBE participation expected absent discrimination effects. The final adjusted figure represents the portion of federal transportation funding that a state must allocate to DBEs for that year, with race-conscious contract goals applied when necessary. The regulations allow for race-conscious measures in DBE participation goals for federally funded transportation contracts. Prime contractors must make good faith efforts to meet these goals by subcontracting to DBEs. The SBA proposed regulations in 2007 to implement set-asides for industries where women-owned small businesses are underrepresented in federal procurement. The SBA conducted a study to identify industries where women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) were underrepresented in federal procurement. Critics argued that the SBA's selected approach was too restrictive, leading to delays in final determinations. The agency extended the comment period in response to a court decision. The SBA extended the comment period in response to a court decision regarding the set-aside program for WOSBs. New regulations require federal agencies to determine if set-asides are related to remedying sex discrimination and analyze their own procurement history for discrimination against WOSBs. Obama Administration proposed regulations in 2010 to withdraw certain provisions. In 2010, the Obama Administration proposed new regulations for the set-aside program for WOSBs, withdrawing previous rules and establishing a new methodology for identifying eligible industries. The SBA stated that the disparity study analysis conducted is sufficient to satisfy the standard for the WOSB Program. The SBA limits the WOSB Program to industries where women are underrepresented. Legal challenges may focus on disparity studies. Lower courts generally find a compelling government interest in affirmative action programs, but there is debate on the \"narrowly tailored\" requirement. The Supreme Court declined to revisit these issues in 2004. In 2004, the Supreme Court refused to revisit issues from Adarand regarding DBE programs in Minnesota and Nebraska. The courts upheld the programs, which set specific goals for awarding contracts to disadvantaged minority businesses. White-owned contractors challenged the awards, claiming race discrimination, but federal district courts upheld the program as constitutional. The federal highway DBE program in Minnesota and Nebraska was upheld by federal district courts, subject to strict scrutiny due to its race-based rebuttable presumption. The program aims to address past discrimination in government contracting markets. Petitioners argued lack of evidence of intentional discrimination, but the courts found Congress had compiled sufficient evidence to support the program. The Eighth Circuit upheld the federal highway DBE program in Minnesota and Nebraska, stating that evidence of past discrimination supported the program. The program must be narrowly tailored and use race-conscious methods only when necessary to address discrimination. Goals for DBE participation are tied to labor market conditions. The Eighth Circuit upheld the federal highway DBE program in Minnesota and Nebraska, stating that evidence of past discrimination supported the program. The program must be narrowly tailored and use race-conscious methods only when necessary to address discrimination. Goals for DBE participation are tied to labor market conditions and have durational limits. Minnesota and Nebraska's implementation of the DBE program was deemed narrowly tailored, as well as the issue presented in Western States Paving Co., Inc. v. Washington State Department of Transportation regarding the constitutionality of TEA-21 for small disadvantaged and minority contractors. DOT regulations presume disadvantaged status for minority groups and women, with eligibility criteria for other groups based on social and economic factors. The Ninth Circuit panel agreed with the Eighth and Tenth Circuits that race and sex preferences for highway contractors under TEA-21 are valid to prevent discrimination in the transportation construction industry. The program aims to ensure federal funding is not distributed in a discriminatory manner and requires states to make good faith efforts to meet goals using race-neutral means. The court found the program to be narrowly tailored to further compelling federal interests. The Washington State program aimed to achieve its goals using race-neutral means and good faith efforts. However, the program was challenged for not being narrowly tailored to address discrimination, as there was no evidence of current or past discrimination in transportation infrastructure contracts within the state. The court emphasized that a narrowly tailored remedy depends on the presence of discrimination. The court emphasized the need for evidence of discrimination to justify minority contracting preferences. In Rothe Development Corporation v. U.S. Department of Defense, a non-minority woman-owned business challenged the constitutionality of DOD's SDB program after losing a contract to a business owned by Korean-Americans. The challenge focused on the 1992 and 2006 reenactments of the statutory authority for the program. The Rothe Development Corporation challenged the constitutionality of DOD's SDB program, which included a 5% participation goal for small disadvantaged businesses in DOD contracts. The program allowed DOD to raise bids of non-DBEs by 10% to give preference to disadvantaged entrepreneurs. After lengthy litigation, the court ultimately held the program unconstitutional as DOD failed to show sufficient evidence of discrimination before Congress during reenactments of the statute. The Federal Circuit ruled that DOD's SBD program was unconstitutional on its face in 2006 as Congress lacked a \"strong basis in evidence\" for race-conscious remedies. The district court had found six state and local disparity studies insufficient as evidence, leading to the program's unconstitutionality. The Federal Circuit found significant methodological flaws in disparity studies used to support the nationwide SDB program, leading to the program being deemed unconstitutional for lacking a \"strong basis in evidence\" for race-conscious remedies. The Federal Circuit found methodological flaws in disparity studies supporting the SDB program, deeming it unconstitutional for lacking a \"strong basis in evidence\" for race-conscious remedies. The studies were not adequately presented before Congress, with insufficient statistical and anecdotal evidence to support the program. The Federal Circuit found a lack of evidence of discrimination in DOD contracts, which could impact the justification for the Department's SDB program. The Rothe decision is significant as it now governs constitutional challenges to minority set-aside programs in bid protests related to federal procurements. The Rothe decision has established judicial jurisdiction over bid protests related to federal procurements post-2001. Congress faces a heavier burden in enacting race-conscious legislation, requiring strong evidence of discrimination. Challenges to the SBA's \u00a7 8(a) program for disadvantaged businesses have also been considered, with courts upholding its constitutionality but requiring a history of discrimination to be proven. The \u00a7 8(a) program requires a history of discrimination in the industry before applying race-based set-asides. Legal challenges to the program are pending, while state and local affirmative action programs face constitutional objections. Courts emphasize the need to identify past discrimination for affirmative action efforts. Local governments must provide specific evidence of past discrimination to support their affirmative action efforts. In Croson, a 30% set-aside for minority subcontractors in the City of Richmond was deemed unconstitutional because it lacked sufficient evidence of discrimination and was not narrowly tailored. The program compared minority contractor participation to general population statistics, rather than qualified minority business enterprises in the market, and included groups without evidence of discrimination. The program's inflexible quota and lack of consideration for race-neutral alternatives also contributed to its failure. The Richmond plan for minority subcontractors was deemed unconstitutional due to lack of evidence of discrimination and inflexibility. The heightened standards of proof from Croson and Adarand led to reevaluation of minority business enterprise programs, with many facing judicial challenges and needing compelling remedial justifications. Studies showing minority exclusion from public contracting were used to support race-conscious programs, but faced criticism after the Adarand decision in 1995. The courts have criticized race-conscious programs for public contracting, citing faults such as over-reliance on general population data, failure to tailor remedies to disparities, and neglect of race-neutral alternatives. Important unresolved issues include different fact-finding standards for state or local minority contracting. The courts have yet to resolve key issues regarding fact-finding standards for state or local minority contracting initiatives. Despite Croson, some circuit courts suggest that no independent findings may be needed to establish a compelling government interest in cases where state agencies act under federal mandate to address discrimination in federally funded projects. The principle is that a federal program with a strong evidentiary basis nationwide can be considered to have a compelling government interest, even if the evidence does not apply to every state or locale. The evidentiary record compiled by Congress for a federal program can provide factual leverage to support state and local actions. In cases where state agencies address discrimination in federally funded projects, a federal program with a strong evidentiary basis nationwide can be considered to have a compelling government interest. In challenges to state programs mandated by federal law, states must show that their programs are narrowly tailored and not discriminatory in the transportation contracting industry. Washington admitted to not conducting statistical studies to establish the existence of discrimination in the highway contracting industry. Washington admitted to not conducting statistical studies to establish discrimination in the highway contracting industry. Arguments made regarding discrimination were rejected by the court, as they failed to consider factors affecting minority contractors' capacity. Historical minority participation in contracts with affirmative action components was deemed insufficient evidence of discrimination. Anecdotal evidence of discrimination was also lacking. The court emphasized that a remedial program must be narrowly tailored to minority groups that have actually suffered discrimination. In a recent ruling, the Seventh Circuit considered the federal government's interest in remedying discrimination in highway contracting. They concluded that a state's DBE program was justified if narrowly tailored. Another Seventh Circuit ruling involved a locally adopted minority contracting program, where Cook County was found to have failed to meet evidentiary requirements. The Seventh Circuit ruled in Western States Paving v. County of Greater Chicago that Cook County's minority contracting program lacked compelling evidence to support its set-aside levels. The program failed to demonstrate a systematic refusal to solicit minority- and women-owned subcontractors, and did not link set-aside levels to market availability. This ruling may impact future challenges to state and federal affirmative action programs. The Ninth Circuit's Western States Paving decision could affect challenges to state and federal affirmative action programs. State programs must show discrimination on a state-by-state basis, while federal programs may face scrutiny over the statistical basis for their enactment. The Supreme Court's Shaw v. Hunt ruling emphasized the need for strong evidence to support race-based governmental actions. The DOT has issued guidance on the impact of the Western States Paving decision in the Ninth Circuit. The Supreme Court's Shaw v. Hunt ruling emphasized the need for strong evidence to support race-based governmental actions, requiring a \"strong basis in evidence\" for race-based governmental action. The Tenth Circuit decision in Adarand III allowed consideration of post-enactment evidence in addition to congressional findings. The Supreme Court declined an appeal from the Tenth Circuit ruling in Concrete Works of Colorado, Inc. v. City and County of Denver, which examined a city ordinance promoting participation by minority- and female-owned businesses in the construction industry. In 1990, Denver City Council passed Ordinance 513 to promote participation by minority- and female-owned businesses in public work projects. The ordinance established MBE and WBE participation goals on city contracts, with annual expenditure goals of 16% for MBEs and 12% for WBEs. The program was revised in 1996 and 1998, reducing the goals for MBEs and WBEs in construction contracts to 10% and prohibiting self-performed work from counting towards the goals. Concrete Works of Colorado, a construction firm owned by a white male, sued the city in 1992 for allegedly being denied contracts for not meeting the goals. The city was sued by Concrete Works of Colorado in 1992 for allegedly being denied contracts for not meeting MBE and WBE participation goals. Evidence presented at trial included disparities in minority and female utilization in construction projects, discrimination faced by M/WBEs in the industry, and the government's justification for racial and gender preferences in public contracting. The circuit court found that Denver did not need \"irrefutable or definitive\" proof of its own guilt in discrimination, only evidence linking its spending to discriminatory exclusion in the construction industry. Denver was not required to identify specific discriminatory practices or policies, nor prove intent to disadvantage women or minorities. Imposing such a burden would undermine reliance on statistical studies and anecdotal evidence. Croson's warning against relying on \"mere societal discrimination\" did not apply if discrimination in the targeted industry was shown. The trial court wrongly required Denver to prove specific discriminatory policies in the construction industry targeted by the program. Factors like firm size and experience were considered important in disparity studies, as M/WBEs might lack the qualifications to perform on city projects. The Tenth Circuit accepted the studies, noting that discrimination led to smaller and less experienced M/WBE construction firms. The disparities persisted even when controlling for these variables. Construction firms, particularly M/WBEs, face discrimination leading to smaller and less experienced companies. Private barriers hinder fair competition for public contracts. The Supreme Court denied an appeal challenging Denver's policy, with dissenters arguing it violated standards set in the Croson decision. The Supreme Court denied an appeal challenging Denver's policy on M/WBEs, with dissenters arguing it violated standards set in the Croson decision by not providing evidence of pervasive discrimination. Justice Scalia criticized the Court for relying on the \"good faith\" of local governments to use racial preferences."
