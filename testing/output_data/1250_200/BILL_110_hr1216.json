Safety Act of 2007, mandates the Secretary of Transportation to consider implementing safety standards for power windows on motor vehicles to prevent accidents involving children and others. If deemed reasonable and practical, these standards must be prescribed within 30 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary must implement safety standards for power windows within 30 months of the Act's enactment. If no additional standards are deemed reasonable, a report must be submitted to relevant committees. Information on vehicles with power windows that automatically reverse direction must be made public. Additionally, a rulemaking to expand rearward visibility must be initiated within 12 months. The Secretary is required to revise FMVSS 111 to expand the driver's field of view behind the vehicle to reduce accidents involving small children and disabled persons. Different types of vehicles may have varying requirements, such as additional mirrors, sensors, or cameras. Final standards must be set within 36 months of the Act's enactment, with a phase-in period for compliance determined by the Secretary. The Secretary will establish a phase-in period for compliance with rearward visibility safety standards, considering different types of motor vehicles based on backing incident data. Regulations will prioritize certain motor vehicle types for phased-in implementation. Additionally, each motor vehicle with an automatic transmission must prevent rolling away. Each motor vehicle with an automatic transmission manufactured after September 1, 2010, must have a system that requires the brake to be depressed before shifting out of \"park\". Violations will be treated as a safety standard offense and subject to enforcement by the Secretary. Manufacturers must submit information on noncompliant vehicles annually. The Secretary must be informed by manufacturers of motor vehicles with automatic transmissions that do not meet the \"park\" position requirements. The Secretary will then publish the non-compliant vehicle models to the public. The definition of a motor vehicle excludes motorcycles and trailers. The Secretary will establish a database of injuries and deaths in nontraffic, noncrash events involving motor vehicles, including information on causes, vehicle details, and other relevant variables to enhance the database's value. The Secretary will provide child safety information about hazards in nontraffic, noncrash incidents by supplementing an existing consumer program or creating a new one. This program will utilize data on nontraffic injuries to establish priorities and address risks to small children. The Secretary will establish a program to address risks to small children in nontraffic incidents and provide information to the public. If deadlines cannot be met, new deadlines will be set and committees will be notified. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
