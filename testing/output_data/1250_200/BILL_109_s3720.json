    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Farm and Ranch Land Protection Flexibility Act of 2006\". The Act includes a Farmland Protection Program. The Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to include new definitions related to eligible land, such as cropland, rangeland, grassland, pasture land, and forest land that is incidental to agricultural operations. The Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to include new definitions related to eligible land, such as cropland, rangeland, grassland, pasture land, and forest land that is incidental to agricultural operations. Riparian areas may comprise up to 50 percent of the offered acreage. The term 'permanent conservation easement' is defined as an interest in eligible land for the primary purpose of protecting agricultural production capacity, and a 'qualified state or local entity' is defined as a public or private entity operating a farm and ranch land protection program. The text chunk discusses the requirements for an entity to purchase permanent conservation easements on farms or ranches, including the authority to monitor and enforce the terms of the easements. The entity must have financial control policies to ensure the purchase price of permanent conservation easements does not exceed the appraised fair market value. The entity must also be certified by the Secretary based on strategic planning, long-term commitment, funds management, and project completion history. The Secretary, through the Natural Resources Conservation Service, will implement a program to facilitate the purchase of conservation easements on eligible land to protect agricultural production capacity by limiting nonagricultural uses. Priority will be given to land with prime soils at risk of non-agricultural development. The Secretary will award grants for the purchase of permanent conservation easements on eligible land with prime soils at risk of non-agricultural development, in rural communities facing conversion pressure, with locally-led land-use planning, and in watersheds benefiting farm and ranch resources. At least 75% of funds will be used for these grants. The Secretary will distribute grants to qualified State or local entities based on need for farm and ranch land protection and funds contributed. Recipients can use the funds to purchase permanent conservation easements, regardless of pending offers, and must only use the funds for this purpose. Grant agreements will be managed by the Secretary. The Secretary may enter agreements with State or local entities to purchase permanent conservation easements using grant funds. The agreements will outline the terms and conditions for using the funds, allowing the entities to determine criteria and priorities for easement purchases. The Secretary can enter agreements with State or local entities to purchase permanent conservation easements using grant funds. The entities can establish terms and conditions for easements based on their criteria and priorities, as long as the State's attorney general certifies effective enforcement of conservation purposes without requiring Federal enforcement rights. The Secretary determines matching funds required from State or local entities for grants based on proposals submitted, including available funds for purchasing conservation easements. The program requires State or local entities to provide matching funds for purchasing conservation easements, with specific criteria for the value of the easement. The program requires State or local entities to provide matching funds for purchasing conservation easements, with specific criteria for the value of the easement. The Secretary shall establish performance measures for farm and ranch land protection, including a qualified contribution of at least 50 percent of the market value made by the landowner in connection with the purchase of a conservation easement. The Secretary will establish performance measures for farm and ranch land protection, along with program coordination to minimize redundancy. Grant funds and technical assistance will remain available for a reasonable period for State or local entities to finalize the purchase of conservation easements."
