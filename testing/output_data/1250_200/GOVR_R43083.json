Startup businesses are seen as crucial for job growth in the national economy. Research suggests that startups, especially those with 20-499 employees, have a positive impact on job creation. However, less than half of startups are still in business after five years, leading to a debate on the effectiveness of providing SBA assistance like guaranteed loans or venture capital. Critics point to the high risk of default, citing examples like the SBIC Participating Securities program. The SBA's SBIC Participating Securities program, established in 1994 to support equity investments in startups, faced significant losses exceeding $2.7 billion after the technology stock market bubble burst from 2000 to 2002. This led to the program's discontinuation in 2004, highlighting the risks of providing venture capital to startups.

The 504/CDC program requires borrowers to meet specific economic development objectives, such as creating or retaining jobs based on the amount of project debenture. If job creation/retention goals are not met, borrowers can fulfill eligibility through community development or public policy goals.

The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program provides financing to small businesses through private capital and leverage borrowed at favorable rates with SBA guarantees. There are 305 licensed SBICs participating in the program as of September 30, 2018. SBICs can apply for financial assistance of up to 300% of their private capital, but SBA typically approves up to 200%.

The early stage debenture SBIC initiative, established in 2012, includes new regulatory provisions to reduce risk and improve recovery. Early stage debenture SBICs are required to raise more regulatory capital, have special distribution rules, and are provided with less leverage compared to debenture SBICs.

The SBA has a tradition of providing assistance to all qualifying small businesses, including startups, without focusing solely on those most likely to contribute to job growth or wealth creation. This aligns with the SBA's mission to promote free markets and prevent monopoly formation.

The SBA's recent initiatives, such as the Growth Accelerators initiative and the early stage debenture SBIC initiative, aim to assist startups in job creation during the economic recovery. These programs are seen as supplements to existing programs, with some viewing the high risk-high reward nature of targeting startups as controversial. While participants report the programs as useful, the data on their impact on economic activity and job creation are limited and subject to methodological challenges."
