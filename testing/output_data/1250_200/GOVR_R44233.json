    "content": "This report provides an overview of U.S. foreign assistance to the Middle East, including historical aid levels, specific country programs, and current issues. Congress authorizes and appropriates foreign aid, with the Middle East being a major recipient. Data sources include USAID's Greenbook, appropriations data, and executive branch notifications. U.S. foreign aid in the region aims to advance core interests, such as support for Israel and peaceful relations. U.S. foreign aid in the Middle East aims to advance core interests such as support for Israel, peaceful relations with Arab neighbors, protection of energy supplies, and fight against terrorism. Assistance supports peace treaties between Israel and Egypt, Jordan, and promotes a \"two-state\" solution with Palestine. Military aid counters Iranian influence in Iraq and Lebanon. New challenges have emerged since the Arab uprisings in 2011, leading to political conflict, sectarian violence, and economic weakening in the region. The wave of unrest in the Middle East has led to governments falling, political conflict, sectarian violence, and weakened economies. Countries like Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Yemen are facing civil wars and terrorist violence, threatening neighboring states. Only Tunisia has made progress towards a stable democratic system, but its gains are fragile. The debate in Congress continues on the amount of resources the US should devote to the region, with bilateral assistance remaining relatively unchanged since 2011. The leading recipients of bilateral foreign aid appropriations in the Middle East have remained relatively unchanged since 2011, with strong Congressional support for Israel and peace efforts. However, the conflicts in Syria and Iraq have prompted new funding sources beyond traditional accounts, totaling over $4 billion for the Syrian refugee crisis since FY2012. Additionally, new funding has been allocated for security assistance in the region to counter the Islamic State. In the 113th Congress, new train and equip authorities were provided to the Defense Department to counter the Islamic State, funded through new appropriations or reprogramming. The conflicts in Syria and Iraq have led to increased regional foreign assistance, including humanitarian spending, military aid to Iraq, support for the Syrian opposition, and aid to neighboring states. The Administration is seeking $3.45 billion for State and Defense Department funding in FY2016 to address the conflicts. Future appropriations may be influenced by domestic budgetary considerations. During the Obama Administration, foreign operations budget remained flat at around $51 billion annually. To address regional crises within budget constraints, officials utilized Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds, exempt from budget caps. Recent aid to Iraq, Syrian opposition, and Jordan, as well as humanitarian crises, were designated as OCO. Lawmakers are considering FY2016 funding and the impact of the Budget Control Act on discretionary spending. The House version of the State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs bill (H.R. 2772) would provide funding. The House version of the State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs bill (H.R. 2772) would provide $47.8 billion in total funding for FY2016, including grant assistance and loan guarantees to non-oil producers in the Middle East region. Multilateral institutions like the IMF have also provided significant loans to countries in the region, totaling over $9 billion, with the condition of economic reforms. Oil-rich Arab Gulf states have increased aid to counter Islamist influence and ensure regime continuity. Gulf countries have provided $30 billion to Egypt since 2013 to counter Islamist influence. Iran also supports allies like Syria and Hezbollah. The Administration requested $7.14 billion for Near East and North Africa countries in FY2016, with a focus on Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and the West Bank. This represents an increase in funding levels compared to previous years. The US provides non-humanitarian aid to Middle Eastern countries including Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and the West Bank and Gaza through various budget accounts. The majority of aid is within the Economic Support Fund (ESF) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF) accounts. Additionally, emergency humanitarian aid is allocated for the crisis in Syria and Iraq. Congress did not provide specific funds for countering the Islamic State in FY2015. For FY2016, OCO funds for countering the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq would make up one-third of the total OCO funds requested. Congress did not allocate specific OCO funds for this purpose in FY2015 but increased OCO funds in various accounts with wording that could be applied to Middle Eastern countries. The US also provides aid through regional programs like Middle East Regional (MER) and Near East Regional Democracy (NERD). The Administration is requesting $40 million in ESF funding for MER in FY2016. The NERD program, funded through ESF, promotes democracy and human rights in Iran. Programming for Iranian activists occurs outside the country due to the regime's resistance. The Administration is requesting $30 million for NERD in FY2016. MERC, managed by USAID and funded through ESF, supports research cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Established in 1979, MERC funds joint Arab-Israeli research in various sectors. The Administration is requesting $5 million for MERC in FY2016. MEM, a State Department-managed program funded through ESF, supports multilateral efforts in the Middle East. The Administration is requesting $5 million in ESF for MERC, which supports research cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors. MEM, funded through ESF, promotes technical cooperation between Arab and Israeli parties. For FY2016, the Administration is requesting $1.4 million in ESF for MEM. TSCTP, funded through multiple foreign assistance accounts, aims to improve counter-terrorism capacity in North and West Africa. The Administration is requesting a total of $69.8 million for TSCTP in FY2016. The Administration is requesting $13.4 million for TSCTP in Near East countries and an additional $19.1 million in PKO for sub-Saharan and North African participant countries. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) selects countries for assistance based on performance in ruling justly, investing in people, and economic freedom. Morocco and Jordan have received MCC grants in the past. In 2007, Morocco signed a $697.5 million agreement with the MCC to assist the private agricultural and tourism sectors. A second compact of $480 million would focus on secondary education and industrial land reform in Morocco. In 2010, Jordan received a $275.1 million compact from the MCC to improve water supply and efficiency in Amman and Zarqa. Critics argue that countries with low democratic indicators should be ineligible for MCC aid, but Jordan performed well on most indicators. Several development analysts argue that Jordan, despite receiving U.S. aid, should be disqualified from receiving aid from the MCC due to its low democratic indicators. The debate over funding democracy promotion in the Arab world has been ongoing since the 9/11 attacks, with increased diplomatic attention and funding towards democracy promotion in the Middle East. The Arab Spring further intensified the debate, with accusations of U.S. interference in domestic affairs in countries like Egypt. U.S. funding for democracy promotion in the Middle East has sparked acrimony in countries like Egypt, with accusations of interference in domestic affairs. The debate over funding democracy promotion in the region continues amidst violent upheaval and authoritarian rule. The White House lacks a single agency responsible for coordinating these efforts, with a request for $442 million in funding for FY2016. U.S. funding for democracy promotion in the Middle East comes from various sources, including the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, USAID, and the National Endowment for Democracy. MEPI, a program within the State Department, supports political reform, women's empowerment, and economic opportunity in the Arab world. Congress has allocated around $913.4 to $960.6 million for MEPI since 2002. MEPI directly funds indigenous NGOs in the Middle East and North Africa through its Local Grants Program, but legal restrictions in some countries pose challenges. In countries with legal restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs, U.S. officials and grant recipients assess risks. Egypt arrested NGO workers in 2011-2013. State Department requests $70 million for MEPI in FY2016. MEPI has allocated $40.8 million in 2015. MEPI plans to spend $8.5 million on local civil society organizations. Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. foreign assistance. U.S. has provided Israel $124.3 billion in bilateral aid, mostly military assistance. Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. foreign assistance, mostly in the form of military aid. Strong congressional support has allowed Israel to receive benefits not available to other countries, such as using some military assistance for research and development in the U.S. and purchasing from Israeli manufacturers. Israel receives its assistance in a lump sum at the beginning of the fiscal year and can also use cash flow financing for U.S. arms purchases. Additionally, Israel receives funds from defense appropriations bills for rocket and missile defense programs. Israel receives military aid from the U.S. State Department and defense appropriations bills for rocket and missile defense programs. In 2007, a 10-year, $30 billion military aid package was agreed upon between the Bush Administration and the Israeli government. Discussions have been held for a possible future aid deal beyond 2018. Egypt has received $76 billion in bilateral foreign aid from the U.S. between 1948 and 2015, with $1.3 billion annually in military aid since 1987. The President requested $1.3 billion in military assistance and $150 million in economic aid for Egypt in FY2016. The FY2015 ESF appropriation for Egypt was $150 million, the lowest since 1978. Aid to Egypt has been conditioned since the military ousted President Morsi in 2013. The FY2015 Consolidated Appropriations Act includes provisions on U.S. assistance to Egypt, with a waiver allowing the Secretary of State to provide aid if it's in the national security interest. Total U.S. aid to Jordan from FY1951 to FY2015 was $15.83 billion, with a non-binding MOU signed in 2015. The U.S. has provided approximately $15.83 billion in foreign assistance to Jordan from FY1951 to FY2015. In FY2015, a non-binding MOU was signed for $1 billion in annual aid from FY2015 to FY2017. The aid includes cash transfers, USAID programs, and military assistance for weapons procurement and maintenance. Jordan uses the aid for debt servicing, supporting Syrian refugees, and enhancing border monitoring capabilities. Jordan receives foreign assistance from the U.S. for weapons procurement, including Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and Blackhawk helicopters for border monitoring and counterterrorism. The U.S. has also provided over $5 billion in bilateral assistance to the Palestinians since the mid-1990s, with conditions and restrictions on aid. Limited bilateral assistance has been provided since FY2014, with funds previously used for budgetary assistance and USAID programs in the West Bank and Gaza. Future plans for aid allocation are uncertain. Future executive branch plans for funds allocation, including potential assistance to the PA budget, are unclear. Most bilateral funds for Gaza are currently focused on humanitarian aid and economic recovery. U.S. assistance for Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria is channeled through UNRWA. The Administration's FY2016 request includes $442.0 million for West Bank and Gaza, with $370.0 million for economic and development programs and $72.0 million for security assistance. Additionally, $3.45 billion is requested for responding to the crisis in Syria and combating the Islamic State. The FY2016 budget request includes $1.82 billion for Department of Defense and State Department security assistance, $1.63 billion for multilateral humanitarian aid. The majority of the request is for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds, including train & equip funds for Iraq and Syria, non-lethal aid to the Syrian opposition, FMF for the Iraqi army, and multilateral humanitarian aid. For FY2016, $715 million is requested for Iraqi train and equip programs and $600 million for Syrian programs, drawn from Department of the Army O&M-OCO funding. In FY2015, $1.6 billion in DOD/OCO funding was provided for an \"Iraq Train and Equip Fund\". The Administration is allocating $1.6 billion for security assistance in Iraq and Syria in FY2016. This includes $1.23 billion for the Iraqi Security Forces, $354 million for Kurdish peshmerga, and $24 million for Sunni tribal fighters. In Syria, $255 million is designated for assistance to opposition groups, with $65 million for non-lethal aid to armed Syrian opposition members. Additionally, $160 million will go towards non-lethal assistance for Syrian national and local-level opposition groups. The FY2016 request includes $250 million in FMF-OCO to support the capabilities of the ISF against the Islamic State. The Administration's budget seeks $5.64 billion in global humanitarian assistance, including $1.63 billion in OCO funds for Syria and Iraq crisis. United States allocated over $4 billion for humanitarian needs from 2011 to 2015. Since 2011, the United States has allocated over $4 billion for humanitarian needs for refugees from Syria and Iraq. The Administration and Congress have discussed adjusting foreign aid policy in response to the changing realities of the Middle East region. The State Department and USAID have repurposed foreign aid towards countries in transition or civil war, but the Administration has argued that this approach is inadequate and limits transparency and flexibility in aid distribution. In FY2013 and FY2014, the Administration sought more legal latitude and additional funding from Congress for Arab transition states. The State Department proposed creating the Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA-IF) in FY2013 and FY2014, but Congress did not authorize or appropriate any funding for it. In FY2015, the Administration requested increased transition support funding for the MENA Initiative using ESF and INCLE-OCO funds. The FY2015 request aimed to support reforms in transitional states using ESF funds at a lower level than previously requested for MENA-IF. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 included language supporting \"Middle East Response\" to provide flexibility in transferring funding for unanticipated contingencies. There have been proposals to restructure U.S. aid to Egypt, with concerns about military aid not aligning with current threats and potentially perpetuating military control. The White House announced the release of selected weapons systems to Egypt in March 2015, seeking continued aid from Congress. The United States will stop providing cash flow financing to Egypt starting in FY2018, despite seeking $1.3 billion in aid from Congress. This decision follows criticism of the financing of expensive weapons systems and concerns about undermining congressional independence. Supporters argue that U.S. military aid should continue to support Egypt's fight against terrorism. The US will phase out cash flow financing to Egypt starting in FY2018, as part of a broader policy approach balancing national security interests and democratic principles. The White House announcement includes maintaining security cooperation while moving away from traditional military-to-military foundations. Public discussion on the proposed policy changes has been limited. The House committee-approved FY2016 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill specifies consultation with the Committees on Appropriations for any plans to restructure military assistance for Egypt. The Secretary of State must consult with the Committees on Appropriations regarding any plans to restructure military assistance for Egypt. Aid to Palestinians is subject to various conditions and restrictions, with no aid allowed for Hamas, the Palestine Liberation Organization, or PA employees in Gaza. Aid for a future Palestinian state or government that includes Hamas would only be permitted if commitments toward peaceful coexistence with Israel are made. Congressional holds have delayed aid disbursement due to Palestinian initiatives for statehood recognition. Congress has also enacted conditions that could reduce U.S. aid to the Palestinians. In response to Palestinian actions regarding the International Criminal Court, some lawmakers have called for the suspension of aid to the Palestinians, but the State Department has stated that relevant restrictions have not been triggered. The U.S. is requesting $134 million for Tunisia in FY2016 to support its transition to democracy, combat terrorism, and promote economic growth. This is more than double the FY2015 request, with 60% allocated for security assistance. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations have reported bills for FY2016, including significant aid for Tunisia. The FY2016 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill (S. 1725) and its accompanying committee reports (H.Rept. 114-154 and S.Rept. 114-79) include Middle East-related provisions. See Table 6 for a comparison of select provisions."
