The Spectrum Relocation Improvement Act of 2008 amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to provide payment for relocation costs to eligible Federal entities affected by frequency reallocation. It requires public notice of relocation plans, including detailed transition plans and information on spectrum relocation requirements, such as geographic locations, frequency bands used, steps for relocation, interactions with NTIA, and responsible staff for relocation efforts. The Federal entity's relocation plans include timelines for using funds, procuring equipment, hiring personnel, field-testing new equipment, and managing risks in the process. The Federal entity must submit transition plans to NTIA at least 60 days before they are made public on NTIA's website. Plans will be evaluated by a 3-member Technical Panel, with reports due within 30 days. The Technical Panel, consisting of members appointed by OMB, NTIA, and FCC, will assess transition plans submitted by the Federal entity for sufficiency, including public information, timelines, and costs. Regulations will be adopted for the Panel's operations within 180 days of enactment. The Technical Panel members will be appointed within 180 days of the Spectrum Relocation Improvement Act of 2008. If classified information is excluded from the transition plan, it must be explained, and non-classified information made available. Section 118 of the Act is amended to include eligibility for payment of relocation costs. The Spectrum Relocation Fund now requires Federal entities to share and coordinate frequencies with commercial licensees during the transition period to be eligible for relocation cost payments. They must also be available for negotiation and discussion with commercial licensees upon request. During the transition period, Federal entities must share classified information with commercial licensees on a need-to-know basis to assist in the relocation process. To be eligible for relocation cost payments from the Spectrum Relocation Fund, a Federal entity must complete the relocation of its spectrum uses within 1 year of receiving funds unless NTIA publicly posts an extension. Federal entities must complete their spectrum relocation within a year of receiving funds, unless an extension is approved by OMB and NTIA. Updates on the transition plan must be provided to NTIA halfway through the process. Payments from the Spectrum Relocation Fund must be made within 30 days of the first license grant after an auction. The dispute resolution process allows for the resolution of disputes between Federal entities and commercial licensees regarding the execution, timing, or cost of spectrum relocation plans. A 3-member board, chaired by a representative of OMB, will rule on disputes within 28 days. The board will be assisted by a Technical Panel. The Spectrum Relocation Improvement Act of 2008 establishes a dispute resolution board to assist in resolving disputes between Federal entities and commercial licensees regarding spectrum relocation plans. The board will be assisted by a Technical Panel, and regulations will be adopted by NTIA within 180 days. Appeals can be made to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit within 30 days of a decision. Each party is responsible for their own costs and expenses."
