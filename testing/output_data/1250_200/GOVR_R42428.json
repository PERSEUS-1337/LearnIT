    "content": "Title V of the Social Security Act funds programs to improve maternal and child health, including the MCH Services Block Grant. Administered by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, it is the largest appropriation under Title V. Established in 1935, Title V aims to support the health of mothers and children, with grant programs for maternal and child health services and services for crippled children. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA, P.L. 99-272) replaced the term \"crippled\" with \"children with special health care needs\" to extend services for children with chronic conditions beyond what is required by children generally. Additional programs targeting children with special health care needs and low-income women and children were added to the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and the Social Security Act (SSA), including services for children with disabilities receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), lead-based paint poisoning prevention programs, genetic disease programs, sudden infant death syndrome programs, hemophilia treatment centers, and adolescent pregnancy grants. The MCH Services Block Grant, established in 1981 by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, consolidated various maternal and child health programs into a single block grant to provide states with more flexibility in addressing these needs. Changes in 1989 increased funding authorization, accountability, and reporting requirements, including a statewide needs assessment. The grant includes block grants to states, a set-aside for Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS), and another set-aside for the Community-Integrated Services Systems (CISS) program. The MCH Services Block Grant, established in 1981, provides funding to states for maternal and child health services. It includes set-asides for SPRANS and CISS programs. The grant was appropriated $638.2 million in FY2016, with funds distributed to states and reserved for specific grants and research. The grant is guided by seven goals outlined in the Social Security Act, focusing on access to quality healthcare for mothers and children, reducing infant mortality, and providing comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care. The MCH Services Block Grant provides funding for maternal and child health services, aiming to improve access to care for low-income mothers and children, reduce infant mortality, and offer comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care. Funds are used for health assessments, diagnostic and treatment services, preventive care, and family-centered care for children with special health needs. Projects funded include MCH workforce development, genetic services, and services for hemophilia. The MCH Services Block Grant funds projects for maternal and child health services, including workforce development, genetic services, and hemophilia treatment. States allocate funds to provide quality health services for low-income mothers and children, with specific percentages designated for preventive care, services for children with special health needs, and other maternal and child health activities. Services covered may include prenatal care, dental care, immunization, family planning, and screening services. The Title V programs, funded by block grants, provide a range of services for women and children, including preventive care, inpatient services for children with special health needs, lead-based poisoning screening, and counseling for parents of sudden infant death syndrome victims. Low-income mothers and children are the focus of the program, with no means test required for recipients of services. The core public health services provided by maternal and child health agencies are structured in a four-level pyramid. Grants to states fund core public health services provided by maternal and child health agencies, structured in a four-level pyramid. Infrastructure building services support health system development, population-based services include screening and prevention campaigns, enabling services provide access for vulnerable populations. In FY2015, Title V block grant funds were primarily allocated to direct health care services for low-income mothers and children, enabling services, population-based services, and infrastructure. The distribution of funds varied by state based on population needs, with direct health care services being a significant expense per person served. The distribution of Title V block grant funds depends on states' population needs and gaps in health and social services. Certain uses of funds are prohibited, such as cash payments to recipients, inpatient services (except for specific cases), and purchases of land or major medical equipment. Funds cannot be used for research or training. States must submit an application to the Secretary of HHS to receive Title V block grant funds, including a needs assessment and a plan to address identified health needs. The needs assessment must align with national health goals and focus on services for pregnant women, infants, children, and those with special health needs. Block grant funds cannot be transferred to other programs or used for research at for-profit entities. Beginning in 2015, the needs assessment will be integrated into the annual report. Title V requires state agencies to coordinate block grant services with Medicaid, including EPSDT. This aims to make Medicaid services accessible, enroll eligible individuals, and avoid duplication of efforts. Coordination also includes other programs like WIC, education, health, developmental disability, and family planning. Interagency agreements outline the expected areas and levels of coordination, with variations in scope and formality. Most agreements specify services provided by each agency, with Title V agencies often contracting health providers for services. The Title V program requires coordination between state agencies for block grant services and Medicaid, including EPSDT. Interagency agreements outline the services provided by each agency, with the Title V agency often contracting health providers. The SPRANS program, administered by HRSA, offers grants for research and training in maternal and child health. Eligible institutions include those that train health personnel or conduct research in maternal and child health. SPRANS projects focus on maternal and child health research, with funds set aside for specific areas like oral health, epilepsy, sickle cell, and fetal alcohol syndrome. These grants aim to improve state systems of care and may also cover genetic disease testing, counseling, and newborn screening. Priority is given to areas with high infant mortality rates, with funding decisions typically made by HRSA or directed by Congress. In FY2016, congressional directives accounted for 16% of SPRANS funding, with specific set-asides for programs like the Family-to-Family Health Information Centers (F2F HICs) and the CISS grant program. F2F HICs provide support and education to families of children with special health care needs, while CISS grants aim to increase service delivery capacity for mothers and children, especially in rural areas. Eligible organizations can receive grants to develop and expand community-based health systems. The CISS grants and contracts support the development and expansion of integrated services at the community level, focusing on maternal and infant health home visiting, increasing participation of healthcare providers, and providing services for women and infants. Roughly 85% of MCH Services Block Grant funds are distributed to states and territories, with 15% distributed competitively under SPRANS. Additionally, 12.75% of funds above $600 million must be reserved for CISS. The MCH Services Block Grant allocates funds to states based on the number of low-income children, with a state match requirement. States can use up to 10% of funds for administrative costs and must maintain funding levels for maternal and child health programs. Funds are awarded quarterly and remain available for expenditure. The MCH Services Block Grant allocates funds to states based on low-income children, with a state match requirement. Funds are awarded quarterly and must be maintained at FY1989 levels for maternal and child health programs. If a state does not use its full allotment, the funds are redistributed among other states. 15% of the block grant funds are awarded competitively for SPRANS, with additional funding for specific programs like Family to Family Information Centers. The CISS program is initiated when the block grant appropriation exceeds $600 million. The CISS program is initiated when the MCH Services Block Grant appropriation exceeds $600 million. 12.75% of any amount appropriated over $600 million is set aside for CISS and distributed competitively to organizations focusing on areas with high infant mortality rates. The MCH Services Block Grant program is authorized to receive $850 million annually, with $638.2 million appropriated for FY2016. Funding for FY2017 is pending enactment, with the President's budget requesting $638.2 million. The MCH Services Block Grant funding was $638.2 million in FY2016, with a decrease of $93.1 million since FY2002. Federal funding may be offset by new Title V programs like the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program. States must provide $3 for every $4 of federal funding, and other funds can support MCH activities. National Title V block grant partnership funding sources are shown in Figure 3 for FY2015. The MCH Services Block Grant receives funding from various sources, including insurance payments and Medicaid reimbursements. Reporting mechanisms required by law include a needs assessment, annual reports, and independent audits. HRSA reports to Congress on activities under SPRANS and CISS programs, along with state reports on block grant activities. National performance measures were established in 1997, with the Title V Information System introduced in 1998 to collect and report state-level data. States and grantees have developed additional measures, with all states reporting annually since 2011. The Title V Information System was introduced in 1998 to collect and report state-level data on performance measures. States report annually on their progress towards achieving National Performance Measures (NPMs) and select 8 out of 15 NPMs for programmatic focus during a five-year reporting cycle. The Title V Information System collects state-level data on performance measures related to children's health. States track progress towards National Performance Measures (NPMs) and select 8 out of 15 NPMs for program focus. The new performance measurement system aims to increase flexibility, reduce reporting burden, and enhance accountability. States must submit annual reports on Title V activities in a standardized format, detailing progress towards national and state health objectives. States must provide annual reports on Title V activities, including program participation, standardized measures of maternal and child health, and data on health systems. States also report 7 to 10 priority needs in their five-year strategic plans, with common priorities including family support services, oral health services, childhood obesity prevention, mental health systems, and services for children with disabilities. The statute requires states to report the number of individuals served by the Title V block grant. States are required to provide annual reports on Title V activities, including the number of individuals served and expenditures by service categories. Maternal and child health measures, such as maternal mortality rates and vaccination rates, are reported to HRSA. These measures include performance and outcome indicators compiled from various sources like birth certificates and surveys. States are mandated to report maternal and child health indicators, workforce data, and access to services for Medicaid and SSI eligible individuals. HRSA compiles this data annually and presents it to congressional committees. In FY2014, 59 states and jurisdictions received MCH Services Block Grant Funding, serving 2.0 million pregnant women and 36.9 million children. Additionally, 3.7 million infants and 7.7 million others received services funded by the block grant. Data on maternal and child health measures reported by states can be found on HRSA websites. In FY2014, 59 states and jurisdictions received MCH Services Block Grant Funding, serving 2.0 million pregnant women and 36.9 million children. Additionally, 3.7 million infants and 7.7 million others received services funded by the block grant. Title V programs serve women and children with private, public insurance, or no insurance coverage. Among children ages 1 to 22 who received Title V-funded services, 34% had Medicaid coverage, 4% had CHIP coverage, 29% had private insurance, and 6% had no insurance. Insurance status was unknown for 27% of children. Federal block grant funds must allocate at least 30% for children with special health care needs, but states have flexibility in directing funds. State funds are not required to follow federal allocation requirements. The curr_chunk discusses selected national and state indicators of maternal and child health reported to HRSA, with data from CDC for comparison. The indicators are relevant to the goals of the MCH Services Block Grant, focusing on outcome measures and performance indicators for maternal and child health funding. Title V funding aims to improve outcome measures and performance indicators for maternal and child health. However, other federal and state programs like Medicaid and WIC, along with societal issues, also impact the well-being of low-income families. The National Survey of Children's Health assesses access to quality healthcare for mothers and children, revealing disparities in insurance coverage based on race, ethnicity, and poverty status. The survey found disparities in health insurance coverage for children based on race, ethnicity, and poverty status. For example, children in households at or below the federal poverty level have lower insurance coverage compared to those in higher-income households. Hispanic children have lower insurance coverage rates compared to non-Hispanic white and black children. Infant mortality rates vary by state and region, with higher rates in the South and Midwest. Mississippi had the highest infant mortality rate among the 50 states. The infant mortality rate varies by state and region, with higher rates in the South and Midwest. Mississippi had the highest rate in 2008, while New Hampshire had the lowest. Factors such as teenage births, prematurity, and inadequate prenatal care disproportionately affect low-income families. Medicaid-eligible populations generally have higher infant mortality rates. Disparities in infant mortality between women enrolled in Medicaid and those who are not also vary widely by state. Late or no prenatal care increases the risk for mothers and children. Prenatal care is crucial for the health of mothers and children. Rates of receiving care in the first trimester vary by state and population, with non-Medicaid populations generally having higher rates. Barriers to receiving prenatal care include lack of insurance and access to a primary care provider, especially among racial and ethnic minorities. Limited availability of maternity care is a concern for Medicaid enrollees. Barriers to early prenatal care include limited availability of maternity care providers, transportation issues, and late enrollment in Medicaid, especially among racial and ethnic minorities. Despite the importance of regular preventive health care for child growth and development, there are persisting barriers to access. Various federal programs, like EPSDT, aim to ensure all children receive quality care. In the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health, 84% of children had a preventive health care visit in the past year, with slight variations among racial and ethnic groups. Uninsured children were less likely to receive preventive care compared to those covered by public insurance. In the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, children with special health care needs often require additional health, mental, and social services beyond preventive care. They are more likely to have injuries that need medical attention, creating additional access and financial burdens on families. Overall, 76% of children did not have unmet needs for specific health care services in the year prior to the survey. In the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, it was found that 76% of children did not have unmet needs for specific health care services. However, children without insurance had a higher proportion of unmet health care needs (56%) compared to children with insurance (23%). Family-centered care, including shared decision-making and coordination with health care providers, was more prevalent among families with insurance coverage. The 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health found that 45% of families with private insurance received family-centered care, compared to 25% of uninsured families. Medical homes, providing access to primary care and a care team, improved health care for children with special needs. State toll-free hotlines assist with Medicaid enrollment, receiving 1.3 million calls in 2012. Access to care varies by state for children with special health care needs. The Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant combines block grants and discretionary grant programs to achieve national maternal and child health objectives, providing flexibility to states while maintaining control over national initiatives. Issues include optimizing federal and state resources, ensuring program effectiveness, and serving over 34 million children, with nearly 15 million having Medicaid or CHIP coverage. Changes under the ACA may impact pregnant women and children served. Changes to public and private insurance markets under the ACA may affect the number of pregnant women and children served by the block grant, with expanded Medicaid eligibility and coverage of preventive care without cost-sharing. Some policymakers argue that the MCH formula block grant is crucial during this transition to ensure continuity of care and reduce coverage gaps. States may redirect block grant funds to meet other maternal and child health goals if Medicaid and CHIP coverage expands. Federal funds in block grants may not be accountable to national concerns, but Congress addresses this with the SPRANS set-aside requirement. States are best suited to use block grant funds in specific situations. Congress has addressed national concerns with the MCH Services Block Grant by requiring the SPRANS set-aside. States are best suited to use block grant funds in situations with wide variability in burden and cost. Title V funding aims to improve outcome measures and performance indicators, but other federal and state programs also impact the health of low-income children and families. Progress towards national health objectives, like reducing infant mortality, has stagnated in recent years due to funding flexibility, varying state circumstances, and societal issues. It is challenging to globally track the direct impact of maternal and child health. Due to the decentralized nature of block grants, measuring program performance and accountability is challenging. The quality of services provided under block grant funding is not currently tracked. Policymakers have promoted alternative programs like the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program and targeted national public health initiatives to improve maternal and child health outcomes. Healthy Start, a national program targeting infant mortality in selected communities, has shown success. The quality of services provided under block grant funding is not currently tracked. Title V contains provisions added or amended by the ACA, including the Abstinence Education program with $50 million in appropriations for FY2010 through FY2014. The Postpartum Depression program, authorized but unfunded, is also included. The ACA allocated $50 million annually for the Title V Abstinence Education block grant from FY2010 to FY2014. Subsequent legislation extended funding through FY2017, increasing the grant to $75 million per year. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program received $1.5 billion from FY2010 to FY2014, with additional funding provided for FY2016 and FY2017. The Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program received extended funding through FY2017, with $400 million allocated for FY2016 and FY2017. 3% of the funding is reserved for research and evaluation, and 3% for grants to tribal entities. The program also includes grants for postpartum depression research and education, as well as a Personal Responsibility Education program. The Personal Responsibility Education program, administered by the Administration for Children and Families, aims to educate adolescents on abstinence, contraception, and adulthood preparation subjects. These subjects include healthy relationships, adolescent development, financial literacy, parent-child communication, educational and career success, and healthy life skills. The program was allocated $75 million annually for FY2010 through FY2014 under the ACA. The ACA allocated $75 million annually for the Personal Responsibility Education program (PREP) for FY2010 through FY2014. The program was extended through FY2017. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau funds over 700 projects each year through discretionary grants. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) funds over 700 projects annually through discretionary grants, capturing performance measures electronically. The MCHB plans to revise performance measures to better align with program goals and Title V Block Grant requirements. The changes aim to accurately reflect the scope of services provided by grant funding. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) is revising performance measures for over 700 projects funded annually through discretionary grants to better align with program goals and Title V Block Grant requirements. The revised measures aim to accurately capture the scope of services provided, reducing the overall number of performance measures and improving data collection to measure various program models and services. This will provide a more detailed picture of services offered through MCHB grant programs."
