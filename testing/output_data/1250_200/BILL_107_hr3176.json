The Hazardous Agent Emergency Uniform Response Act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop protocols for responding to public health emergencies involving dangerous biological agents or chemicals, including intentional releases. The Act defines hazardous agents as dangerous biological agents and chemicals, with specific criteria for what constitutes a dangerous biological agent. The Hazardous Agent Emergency Uniform Response Act defines dangerous biological agents as those listed in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and not exempted from regulations. It also includes dangerous chemicals listed by the Secretary in consultation with the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board. The Hazardous Agent Emergency Uniform Response Act identifies substances known to cause death or serious health effects, including those listed under section 112(r)(3) of the Act. Protocols are developed for each hazardous agent, with specific provisions unless the agent has no unique characteristics relevant to a public health emergency response. Priorities and timeframes are set within 45 days for response protocols. The Secretary must establish priorities for hazardous agents within 45 days of the Act's enactment. Protocols for the highest priority agent must be developed promptly, with a goal of completion within 45 days.

Additionally, the Secretary shall periodically review the protocols. The Secretary will periodically review and revise protocols for hazardous agents as needed.
