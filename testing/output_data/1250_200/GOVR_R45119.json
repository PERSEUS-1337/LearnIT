    "content": "In October 2017, the U.S. EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan (CPP), a rule finalized in 2015 to limit CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel-fired power plants. The CPP has faced legal challenges and has not been implemented. Disagreements revolve around legal justification, design, and costs. The CPP set national CO2 emission rates for power plants, with states given compliance choices. States could comply through a \"rate-based\" or \"mass-based\" approach. The proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) by the U.S. EPA in 2017 marks a significant change from the previous Administration's stance on emissions regulations. The CPP aimed to limit CO2 emissions from power plants through a rate-based or mass-based approach, providing states with flexibility in compliance. The EPA projected a 32% reduction in total power sector CO2 emissions nationwide by 2030 under the CPP. The repeal is based on the current Administration's interpretation that the CPP exceeds legal authority under the Clean Air Act. The EPA determined that the Clean Power Plan (CPP) exceeds legal authority under the Clean Air Act by setting CO2 emission goals for existing power plants that are difficult to achieve. The agency also conducted a benefit-cost analysis of the proposed repeal, revealing methodological changes that may impact future regulations. Members of Congress may be interested in understanding these differences in analysis. Members of Congress may want to understand EPA's analysis of the proposed repeal of the Clean Power Plan, specifically the changes in benefit-cost comparisons between 2017 and 2015. A group of 19 Senators requested more information on the benefit-cost analysis, which could influence how federal agencies consider climate and health benefits in future regulations. The report summarizes EPA's analysis of the CPP's impacts and highlights differences in economic analysis between the 2017 proposed repeal and the 2015 final rule. The section provides background on regulatory analysis requirements for executive branch agencies, an overview of EPA's 2015 and 2017 analyses, and compares the conclusions of the benefit-cost analyses. It describes three primary changes in the 2017 analysis and concludes with observations. EPA prepares benefit-cost analyses for significant regulatory actions, such as the Clean Power Plan, in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and OMB Circular A-4. The regulatory analysis directives in Executive Order 12866 remain in effect today, requiring federal agencies to assess the benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions. Rules meeting certain criteria are considered economically significant and must undergo a detailed regulatory analysis.OMB Circular A-4 provides further guidance on what constitutes a \"good regulatory analysis.\" OMB Circular A-4 elaborates on the principles outlined in E.O. 12866 for regulatory analysis, defining a good regulatory analysis as one that states the need for regulatory action, analyzes alternative approaches, and assesses benefits and costs. It aims to standardize measurement and reporting of benefits and costs of significant regulatory actions across federal agencies, emphasizing that benefits should justify costs without requiring monetized benefits to outweigh costs. The document recognizes that quantified estimates may not capture all impacts, directing agencies to quantify benefits and costs of economically significant regulations. When the EPA promulgated the CPP in 2015, it prepared a regulatory analysis in accordance with E.O. 12866, OMB Circular A-4, and the agency's Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses. The analysis included state-specific emission rate goals for the rate-based scenario and state-specific emission goals for the mass-based scenario, which were considered illustrative in nature. EPA emphasized that the impacts estimated under these scenarios were not definitive but represented their best assessment of the likely impacts of the CPP under various state approaches. EPA estimated emission reductions and compliance costs under two scenarios using the Integrated Planning Model (IPM). Compliance costs included capital investment, operating pollution controls, fuel shifts, energy efficiency measures, and monitoring costs. The CPP was expected to reduce CO2 and non-GHG emissions. EPA used the IPM model to estimate CO2 reductions. EPA estimated the economic value of climate benefits by using the social cost of carbon (SCC) and quantified human health benefits from reductions in non-GHG emissions like SO2 and NOx. The SCC includes impacts on agricultural productivity, property damage, and energy system costs. EPA monetized the health benefits of reduced exposure to PM and ozone using a \"benefit-per-ton\" approach. The EPA used a \"benefit-per-ton\" approach to estimate the dollar value of human health benefits from reducing pollutants like PM and ozone. The majority of health co-benefits came from PM reductions, with SO2 emissions playing a significant role. Ozone health effects accounted for a smaller share of the monetized health co-benefits. The EPA proposed to repeal the CPP two years after finalizing it under the Obama Administration. The agency revisited the 2015 CPP regulatory analysis for the repeal, which qualified as an economically significant regulatory action. EPA prepared a regulatory analysis in accordance with E.O. 12866, OMB Circular A-4, and the agency's Guidelines for Preparing Economic Analyses. The EPA prepared a regulatory analysis for the proposed repeal of the CPP, defining benefits as avoided compliance costs and costs as forgone reductions in emissions and associated climate and health benefits. The agency plans to conduct updated modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the repeal. The EPA conducted updated modeling using IPM for public comment before finalizing the proposed repeal of the CPP. The benefit-cost estimates were based on power sector modeling results from 2015 and more recent projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2017. EPA also changed the accounting treatment of cost savings from demand-side energy efficiency measures. In 2017, EPA changed the accounting treatment of cost savings from demand-side energy efficiency measures, counting them as a positive benefit of the CPP. The 2017 analysis showed less favorable benefit-cost comparisons compared to the 2015 analysis. Net impact estimates in 2015 showed benefits outweighing costs, while in 2017, estimates ranged from costs outweighing benefits to benefits outweighing costs. The 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal of the CPP showed a range of net costs and net benefits, with estimates for 2030 ranging from $28.3 billion in net costs to $14 billion in net benefits. The benefit-cost estimates derived from the AEO 2017 projections also showed a range of net costs and net benefits, with half showing net benefits and half showing net costs. The AEO-based estimates for 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits. The AEO-based estimates of the proposed repeal for 2030 ranged from $30.6 billion in net costs to $14.0 billion in net benefits. The effect of updated power sector projections on the proposed repeal's benefit-cost estimates is unclear, as changes in the power sector have occurred since 2015. These changes include shifts to lower-emitting sources, potentially impacting CO2 emission reductions and compliance costs under the CPP. EPA plans to update its power sector modeling before finalizing the decision. EPA plans to update its power sector modeling before finalizing the proposed repeal of the CPP. AEO 2017 projections showed higher human health co-benefits and greater reduction in coal emissions under the CPP compared to EPA's 2015 estimates. EPA revised its analysis of the CPP's benefits and costs by changing estimates of the SCC and assuming no human health impacts. The EPA revised estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) by excluding international impacts of U.S. emissions, discounting future benefits of CO2 reductions, and assuming no human health co-benefits below certain pollution thresholds. These changes affected the conclusions of the EPA's analysis in 2015 compared to 2017, with the third change modifying estimates of compliance costs and benefits of the Clean Power Plan. The SCC is used to value climate benefits of CO2 reductions and represents the monetary value of impacts from changes in CO2 emissions. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) values are calculated using models to estimate the monetary value of climate benefits associated with changes in emissions. In 2015, the EPA estimated the climate benefits of the Clean Power Plan using SCC values developed by an interagency working group (IWG). The Trump Administration withdrew the IWG's SCC estimates in 2017 as part of an executive order directing federal agencies to review energy development requirements. The Trump Administration disbanded the IWG and directed agencies to use OMB Circular A-4 guidance for regulatory analysis, focusing on domestic benefits and costs with discount rates of 3% and 7%. EPA developed new interim SCC values based on this directive, using similar models as the IWG but calculating domestic estimates separately. The EPA used three models to calculate domestic SCC estimates, adjusting global values to domestic values. The interim estimates are $7 and $1 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2030 at discount rates of 3% and 7%. Stakeholders have debated using domestic or global SCC values, with the IWG recommending global values due to the global impact of GHGs. The IWG recommended global values for the SCC in 2010, emphasizing the global damages caused by GHG emissions. EPA agreed in 2015, citing the interconnected global economy and spillover effects on national security, trade, and public health. Stakeholders supported global SCC estimates, noting that U.S. emissions have impacts beyond its borders. Those advocating for global values argued that there is no clear distinction between domestic and global climate change impacts. In 2015, stakeholders recommended federal agencies use domestic SCC estimates, aligning with OMB Circular A-4 guidance. Critics argued that using a global SCC for U.S. climate regulations could overstate benefits by including non-U.S. populations. EPA focused on domestic SCC estimates in the 2017 analysis of the proposed repeal, citing E.O. 13873 and OMB Circular A-4, although global values were not prohibited. The focus on domestic SCC estimates is explained, with Circular A-4 allowing consideration of global values but emphasizing benefits and costs for U.S. citizens. EPA included global estimates in a sensitivity analysis but did not compare them to the costs of the proposed repeal. Challenges in accurately estimating domestic SCC were acknowledged, including difficulties in capturing regional interactions and impacts beyond U.S. borders. The National Academies of Sciences also noted limitations in current models used for estimating SCC. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) and OMB Circular A-4 discuss the challenges in estimating the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). Circular A-4 recommends discount rates of 3% and 7% based on different scenarios affecting consumer spending or private capital. The 3% rate is tied to future consumption, while the 7% rate reflects the opportunity cost of capital. Discounting is the final step in calculating SCC, which models estimate over a long time period. Discounting in the SCC calculation allows for comparisons of economic impacts at different times. Selecting a discount rate for intergenerational climate change impacts is challenging as it involves valuing future generations' experiences without their input. The current generation must consider future preferences, which can be complex when balancing current and future interests. There is no consensus on the appropriate discount rate in an intergenerational context, but it is crucial to acknowledge the implications of higher rates. The appropriate discount rate for intergenerational climate change impacts is crucial, as higher rates result in lower present values. OMB Circular A-4 recommends sensitivity analysis with lower discount rates, suggesting rates in the 1% to 3% range. The Council of Economic Advisers under the Obama Administration proposed reducing the 3% rate to at most 2% and lowering the 7% rate. Stakeholders hold divergent views on discount rate selection for the SCC. The council recommended reducing the 3% rate to 2% and lowering the 7% rate. Stakeholders have differing views on discount rate selection for the SCC, with environmental groups advocating for lower rates and industry groups for higher rates. The majority of climate change impact studies use rates of no more than 5%. The IWG suggested discount rates of 2.5%, 3%, and 5% for the SCC. EPA agreed with these rates in the 2015 CPP analysis. In the 2015 CPP analysis, EPA agreed with the IWG's selection of discount rates for the SCC at 2.5%, 3%, and 5%. Academics have recommended different ways to calculate discount rates, with the NAS suggesting a new approach to better capture uncertainty over long periods of time. The NAS criticized the OMB Circular A-4 guidance for not fully addressing discounting over long horizons or the effect of uncertainty on discount rates. EPA estimated lower climate benefits of the proposed repeal using interim SCC estimates in 2017 compared to 2015, applying lower SCC values in the 2017 analysis. EPA's 2017 analysis had lower benefit estimates than the 2015 analysis, with reduced climate benefits under the CPP due to lower SCC values. The agency conducted a sensitivity analysis using global values and a 2.5% discount rate, but did not compare these estimates to compliance costs. The 2017 analysis also excluded some human health co-benefits from benefit-cost comparisons. The EPA's benefit-cost comparisons varied in their treatment of health co-benefits, with some excluding them entirely to focus on the targeted pollutant, CO2. This approach was seen as inconsistent with OMB's guidance, but EPA defended it as a way to evaluate regulatory actions more effectively. Public comment was requested on this approach. The EPA requested public comment on the consideration of co-benefits in regulatory actions, specifically regarding reductions in pollutants relative to costs. Stakeholders raised concerns about the inclusion of co-benefits in the analysis of regulations targeting pollutants, questioning potential double counting of benefits. The EPA's 2015 analysis stated that human health co-benefits were incremental to existing regulations. Consideration of co-benefits is consistent with federal guidance on benefit-cost analysis. The EPA follows federal guidance on benefit-cost analysis by considering co-benefits in regulatory actions. OMB Circular A-4 directs agencies to quantify and monetize co-benefits and adverse impacts. EPA's economic analysis includes intended effects, costs, and ancillary benefits. OMB reports that EPA's Clean Air Act analyses monetize co-benefits, mainly from reducing public exposure to fine particulate matter. This approach is consistent with standard accounting practices. EPA applies a threshold to include health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons. The EPA has long required benefit-cost analysis under OMB Circular A-4. Recent comparisons included some estimated health co-benefits, applying thresholds for PM levels. The 2017 analysis diverged from past practice by using thresholds to calculate PM mortality impacts. EPA assumed no deaths below certain PM levels in the comparisons. The EPA used thresholds for PM levels in benefit-cost comparisons, assuming no deaths below certain levels. The PM air quality standard threshold had a greater impact on co-benefit estimates compared to the LML threshold. This affected the favorability of the proposed repeal in benefit-cost comparisons. EPA justified the use of these thresholds to enhance transparency and address uncertainty in estimating PM-related health risks. The EPA justified using thresholds to address uncertainty in estimating PM-related health risks, citing studies that support a no-threshold model for PM-mortality concentration-response relationship. The agency acknowledged lower confidence in benefits at lower PM concentrations but did not apply a threshold, stating that federal air quality standards are not risk-free. EPA stated that federal air quality standards are not \"risk-free,\" acknowledging some health risks from pollution meeting the standard. Their 2015 analysis supported benefits estimation above and below the standard, aligning with scientific evidence. In 2017, EPA sought feedback on estimating PM impacts and planned further research to evaluate the benefit-per-ton approach. They aim to conduct detailed air quality modeling to inform threshold-based analysis of PM benefits and changed the accounting treatment of energy efficiency savings. EPA changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings in their analysis. In 2015, savings were treated as a negative cost, reducing compliance cost estimates. In 2017, savings were treated as a benefit, following OMB guidance. The proposed repeal removed energy savings from total cost estimates, resulting in larger cost and benefits estimates. This accounting change did not alter the difference between benefits and costs. The accounting change in the EPA's analysis under E.O. 13771 resulted in higher estimates of costs and benefits for the proposed repeal. The analysis reported cost savings but omitted the forgone benefits, focusing on avoided compliance costs from 2020-2033. Demand-side energy efficiency savings were not included in this cost analysis. The EPA's analysis under E.O. 13771 showed higher estimates of costs and benefits for the proposed repeal, focusing on avoided compliance costs from 2020-2033. Benefit-cost analysis informs policy decisions by evaluating potential effects of regulatory options, but does not solely determine decisions. Decisionmakers consider various factors beyond monetary benefits and costs when finalizing regulatory actions. When developing regulatory proposals, decisionmakers consider legal, technical, statutory, and ethical factors. For example, the EPA's proposed CPP repeal was based on a change in legal interpretation and adherence to rulemaking procedures. Quantifying benefits and costs involves complex tasks drawing upon scientific data and policy decisions. Changes in policy priorities and technical information can influence the estimation of benefits and costs, as seen in the differences between the 2015 CPP analysis and the 2017 proposed repeal. EPA's 2017 benefit-cost analysis reached different conclusions due to changes in estimating economic impacts, particularly the use of new SCC estimates. The 2015 analysis differed from the 2017 analysis mainly due to changes in estimating economic impacts, such as using new SCC estimates and thresholds for human health co-benefits. Congress has varying views on EPA regulatory policy, especially regarding GHG-related regulations like the CPP. The differences in benefits and costs assessment between the two Administrations reflect their policy priorities. The 2017 analysis used interim SCC estimates in response to E.O. 13783, indicating a shift in governmental policy. The interim SCC estimates, developed in response to E.O. 13783, differed from the IWG's methodology in scope and discount rates, lowering the estimated CPP climate benefits. Congress may face challenges in harmonizing federal agencies' decisions on GHG-related regulations. EPA's 2017 analysis lacked details on future SCC updates and implications for federal analyses. The EPA's estimate of climate change impacts in the U.S. lacks a timeline for updates, raising questions about other agencies' use of interim estimates. The Department of Energy and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management have taken different approaches. Congress may consider the precedent set by EPA's changes to health co-benefits analysis. The 2017 analysis reflected different policy determinations than the 2015 analysis, with uncertainty in benefits from PM reductions. The 2017 EPA analysis on PM reductions lacked a clear threshold for setting a limit, unlike previous analyses. It departed from the 2015 analysis by excluding health co-benefits in benefit-cost comparisons."
