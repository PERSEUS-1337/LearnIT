    "content": "Designation of military installations and certain communities as enterprise zones and redevelopment areas. Designation of military installations selected for closure or realignment as enterprise zones and redevelopment areas by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Secretary of Commerce respectively. The designated zones and areas include the local communities within the jurisdiction of the military installations. The designations of military installations as enterprise zones and redevelopment areas must be made within 60 days of being recommended for closure or realignment. Enterprise zones designated under subsection (a) are in addition to the 100 authorized zones. In addition to the 100 authorized enterprise zones, military installations can be designated as redevelopment areas for a 5-year period. The Secretary of Commerce will review the area annually and may terminate or modify the designation if it does not meet requirements. Funding for economic adjustment or community planning in enterprise zones can come from programs administered by the Secretary of Defense or Commerce. The Works and Economic Development of 1965 allows for the designation of military installations as redevelopment areas for a 5-year period. The Secretary of Commerce can terminate or modify the designation if requirements are not met. The term \"base closure law\" refers to specific acts related to base closures, and \"substantial realignment\" means a significant reduction in military installation operations. Priority is given to commercial use of property on military installations designated as enterprise zones and redevelopment areas. The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act is amended to restrict the use of buildings on military installations designated as enterprise zones or redevelopment areas for homeless assistance until they are no longer considered for commercial or redevelopment uses."
