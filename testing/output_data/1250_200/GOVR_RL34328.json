It includes provisions for research funding, early career grants, ARPA-E, and Innovation Institutes at DOE National Laboratories. The America COMPETES Act authorizes programs at government agencies for STEM education and training, including scholarships, teacher recruitment, student-focused programs, and new STEM activities. This includes initiatives at DOE, ED, and NSF to enhance STEM education through various programs and activities. The America COMPETES Act authorizes programs at government agencies for STEM education and training, including scholarships, teacher recruitment, student-focused programs, and new STEM activities. It also includes White House efforts to foster innovation and competitiveness activities. Scientific and technological advances contribute to economic growth by creating new goods, services, jobs, and capital, or increasing productivity. Since World War II, the United States has used direct and indirect policy approaches to enhance competitiveness. Concerns about competition from other economies arose, especially in the 1970s when the US lost market share in various industries to Japan, Europe, and newly industrialized countries. The United States lost market share in various industries to Japan, Europe, and newly industrialized countries. Concerns were raised about declining technological superiority, lower productivity growth, and a narrowing gap in the number of scientists and engineers compared to Japan and West Germany. Congress responded by passing the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980. In response to concerns about declining technological superiority and competitiveness, Congress passed several acts in the 1980s to promote research and development, including the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act, the Bayh-Dole Act, and the Federal Technology Transfer Act. Additional measures included the creation of the SEMATECH consortium and tax incentives for corporate R&D spending. The Small Business Development Act also supported innovative small firms with federal R&D funds. These actions aimed to address the United States' economic competitiveness concerns until the mid-1990s. In the 1980s, Congress passed acts to promote research and development to address concerns about declining technological superiority and competitiveness. The United States economy and technological innovation improved in the mid-1990s. Today's competitiveness concerns focus on globalization, federal science and engineering research funding, STEM education quality, and the number of Americans obtaining science and engineering degrees. American companies rely on international markets for production and export. The globalization of the economy has both positive and negative impacts on American companies, workers, and families. American companies rely on international markets for over 50% of their sales and employ more foreign workers than domestic. Increasing integration with the world economy can lead to higher productivity and living standards, but also raises concerns about job loss and lower wages. Technology, increased global labor supply, and government policies are the key drivers of today's globalization trends. The America COMPETES Act addresses globalization trends by authorizing direct measures to increase federal funding for basic research in key fields like physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. It also establishes committees to explore indirect policy mechanisms for promoting competitiveness and job creation. The America COMPETES Act aims to enhance innovation and job creation by funding high-risk research at small businesses, improving STEM education, and identifying actions to boost U.S. competitiveness in labor and trade. The America COMPETES Act aims to enhance innovation and job creation by funding high-risk research at small businesses, improving STEM education, and identifying actions to boost U.S. competitiveness in labor and trade. Legislative initiatives propose federal efforts to encourage industry spending on research and development, promote joint research activities, facilitate technology transfer, and provide incentives for quality improvements. Experts have differing opinions on the best actions to take to improve competitiveness. The United States trade balance in high technology products shifted from a surplus to a deficit in the early 2000s, with the deficit growing steadily each year. The United States trade deficit in high technology products grew steadily from $43.6 billion in 2005 to $55.5 billion in 2008. This deficit raises concerns about competitiveness and foreign direct investment in the US. The United States saw a decline in foreign investments after 2000 but rebounded to $184 billion by 2006. Domestic labor is concerned about competitiveness against foreign firms and job creation. The US is the largest recipient and investor of foreign direct investments, with $249 billion invested abroad in 2006. Concerns exist about displaced workers and lower wages, with 70% of investments going to high-income developed countries. Most economists believe that U.S. foreign direct investment in high-income developed countries does not result in job losses or lower incomes for Americans. The classification of science and engineering occupations by NSF does not account for all individuals with science and engineering degrees who use their knowledge in different fields. The classification of science and engineering occupations by NSF does not include all individuals with S&E degrees who use their knowledge in various fields. The science and engineering workforce may be larger than government analyses suggest, with estimates ranging from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals in 2006, according to the National Science Board. The engineering workforce in 2006 varied between approximately 5.0 million and 21.4 million individuals. The National Science Board suggests that the most relevant numbers may be 17.0 million or 21.4 million, reflecting individuals with degrees in science and engineering fields or related fields. This differs from other data sources such as NSF, U.S. Census Bureau, and BLS. Statistical analysts find it challenging to account for the need for STEM knowledge in all workers and the impact of new technologies on employment skills. Figure 2 shows how skills needed for employment have changed due to computerization. The analysis in Figure 2 illustrates how computerization has shifted employment skills, reducing routine tasks and increasing high-level tasks. This shift has led to a higher demand for college-educated workers. The U.S. Census Bureau data in Figure 3 shows significant growth in science and engineering occupations compared to the total labor force. Recent BLS data on STEM workforce trends show mixed results, including a decline in STEM professionals as a percentage of the employed civilian population. Recent data from BLS shows a decline in STEM professionals as a percentage of the employed civilian workforce since 2000. However, science and engineering occupations are projected to grow by 21.4% from 2004 to 2014, with faster growth expected in computer-related occupations, life sciences, social sciences, and other S&E-related fields. Unemployment in S&E occupations was 1.6% in 2006, and compensation for most STEM occupations is above the U.S. labor force average. STEM occupations have higher compensation compared to the U.S. labor force, with salaries ranging from $53,000 to $58,000 per year. The mean real salary for recent S&E bachelor's degree recipients increased by 15% from 1993 to 2003. Median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders 15-19 years after receiving their degree were $65,000, higher than non-S&E bachelor's degree recipients. Variance exists among STEM occupations, fields, and sub-fields, impacting competitiveness measures. The Council on Competitiveness highlights the limitations of current assessments of a nation's competitiveness, emphasizing the importance of factors like foreign affiliate sales, global supply chains, and intangibles such as knowledge and intellectual property. They suggest that traditional measures like trade balance are less relevant in today's global economy. For individuals, additional measures like pension funds, real estate, healthcare benefits, and purchasing power should be considered to understand prosperity. The America COMPETES Act is based on assumptions regarding STEM knowledge. The America COMPETES Act is based on the assumption that STEM knowledge is essential for all Americans, not just those in science and engineering careers. It emphasizes the need for more STEM teachers and professionals to generate enthusiasm in students, leading to a competitive workforce. Encouraging more Americans to pursue STEM fields is crucial for innovation and economic competitiveness. STEM degree holders are versatile and can work in various occupations beyond their field. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the importance of STEM knowledge for all Americans, not just those in science and engineering careers. It highlights the need for more STEM teachers and professionals to inspire students and create a competitive workforce. STEM degree holders can work in diverse occupations beyond their field. Current basic research funding in science and engineering is insufficient compared to other countries, impacting U.S. competitiveness. Additional federal funding in these areas can lead to the creation of new industries and jobs, as well as enhance existing ones. The United States has lower scores in literacy and mathematics compared to the OECD average. Middle school math teachers are not well-prepared, contributing to lower scores for American students. The country also has low rates of STEM degrees awarded compared to non-STEM degrees. Investment in research and development has positively impacted U.S. economic growth. Investment in research and development has positively impacted U.S. economic growth. Some question the extent of exclusive benefits from federal research programs and whether STEM education is a state or federal issue. Others doubt if federal investments in research and STEM education will enhance U.S. competitiveness, as other factors also play a role. Some analysts question the necessity of actions to enhance U.S. competitiveness through STEM research and education, doubting if additional scientists and engineers are needed. Concerns also arise about potential oversupply, management of increased funding, and challenges faced by agencies. The American Competitiveness Act proposes both direct and indirect measures to address funding challenges in technology development. Supporters of direct government assistance argue for focusing on promising technologies, while indirect policy proponents believe the market should decide. Critics of indirect measures argue they are wasteful and ineffective, while supporters believe they enhance market opportunities. President Bush announced the Act to enhance U.S. competitiveness. President Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative in January 2006 during his State of the Union address. The America COMPETES Act and the ACI aimed to address concerns about the United States' ability to compete economically in the future due to insufficient investment in science and technology research. Many provisions of ACI were included in the America COMPETES Act, such as increased research funding at NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, as well as STEM education programs like Math Now and the AP/IB program. The America COMPETES Act also authorized funding increases for NSF, NIST, DOE Office of Science, and established new research organizations like ARPA-E and Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes. The America COMPETES Act authorizes increased funding for research agencies like NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, as well as the establishment of new research organizations like ARPA-E and Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes. It also calls for executive agencies to allocate a percentage of their budget to high-risk, high-reward basic research projects and advocates for increased funding for physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science based on the National Academies' recommendations. The America COMPETES Act is based on the National Academies Rising Above the Gathering Storm report, recommending a 10% annual increase in federal investment in basic research over seven years. This is crucial for fields like physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences, as stagnant funding hinders high-potential high-risk research. The report highlights that corporations are unlikely to fill this gap due to the risky nature of basic research. The National Academies committee recommended a 10% annual increase in federal investment in basic research over seven years, based on the America COMPETES Act. The Administration's chosen 7% annual rate for doubling research budgets over 10 years was questioned, with concerns about limited funding availability and the importance of federally funded science for economic competitiveness. The Academies' 2005 report \"Rising Above the Gathering Storm\u2026\" recommended increased funding for basic research in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering. The American Competitiveness Initiative proposed doubling budgets for NSF, NIST, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science over ten years. The America COMPETES Act emphasized NASA's role in promoting innovation and economic competitiveness through scientific research and STEM education. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes NASA's role in promoting innovation and economic competitiveness through scientific research and STEM education. Concerns have been raised about the balance of funding in NASA's budget and the agency being asked to accomplish too much with insufficient funds. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the need for NASA to align its tasks with available resources. It also calls for high-risk, high-reward projects to address scientific challenges and promote innovation. Researchers have raised concerns about the lack of openness in federal research funding mechanisms. The National Science Board (NSB) and National Institutes of Health are concerned about the lack of support for transformative research, which is seen as revolutionary and cutting edge. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 emphasizes the importance of fostering high-risk research to address scientific challenges and promote innovation. The National Science Board and National Institutes of Health are concerned about the lack of support for transformative research. The Appropriations Committees direct the National Science Foundation to review current practices supporting transformational proposals and provide semi-annual reports on addressing this area. The House Committee on Appropriations suggests allocating $10 million for a new program emphasizing transformative research. The America COMPETES Act authorizes ARPA-E to develop technologies that enhance economic and energy security. ARPA-E aims to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States by reducing foreign energy imports, cutting energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy efficiency, and leading in advanced energy technologies. Modeled after DARPA, ARPA-E promotes revolutionary advances in science and technology to address challenges that industry may not undertake due to technical and financial uncertainties. The concept for ARPA-E was inspired by the National Academies report Rising Above the Gathering Storm, which proposed applying the DARPA model to other parts of the federal research system. The National Academies report Rising Above the Gathering Storm proposed the DARPA model for the U.S. federal research system. Various initiatives, including a civilian technology agency, were suggested in the past. In 1992, a National Academy of Sciences report recommended a civilian technology corporation for energy research. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore proposed a civilian advanced research agency for renewable technologies. ARPA-E, inspired by the DARPA model, aims to bring excitement and attract top minds to energy research. The National Academies report proposed creating an ARPA-like organization for energy research, focusing on creative and transformational projects. Funding for ARPA-E was suggested to start at $300 million and increase to $1 billion per year over five to six years, with evaluations for effectiveness. The National Academies report proposed creating an ARPA-like organization for energy research, with funding starting at $300 million and increasing to $1 billion per year over five to six years. The program's effectiveness would be evaluated, and it was emphasized that ARPA-E funding should not jeopardize basic research supported by the DOE's Office of Science. Details of ARPA-E's organization and mission were to be determined by the Secretary of Energy and the Under Secretary for Science in consultation with experts. The America COMPETES Act directed DOE to establish multidisciplinary Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at National Laboratories for research and technological innovations. The America COMPETES Act directed DOE to establish Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at National Laboratories to support research on emerging technologies critical to global competitiveness. The Institutes aim to train science and engineering students, develop educational curricula, conduct research with partners, and create innovative technologies. Proponents believe this will reshape engineering research and education to address challenges in global markets, national security, energy sustainability, and public health. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new STEM education programs involving various sectors of society to enhance STEM teaching and student participation. Programs focus on recruiting and training STEM teachers, providing educational opportunities like summer institutes and research internships, and promoting outreach and mentoring for women, minorities, and students from high-need schools. Additionally, the Act includes grants for establishing STEM specialty high schools and experiential learning opportunities for middle and high school students. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new STEM education programs including statewide specialty high schools in STEM, internships for students, centers of excellence in STEM education, summer institutes for teachers, a Director for STEM Education at the Department of Energy, a graduate research fellowship program, and two new grant programs at the Department of Education for STEM courses leading to teacher certification. The Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program aims to improve STEM education by offering baccalaureate degrees with teacher certification, master's degree programs for current teachers, and a one-year program for STEM professionals. Additionally, the Math Now program focuses on enhancing math instruction for elementary and middle school students, while the Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate Program aims to expand access to AP/IB coursework for low-income students. Increased support is also provided for existing NSF programs like the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program. The America COMPETES Act programs include the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, Math and Science Partnerships program, STEM talent expansion program (STEP), Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, Graduate Research Fellowships (GRF), and Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program. These programs aim to improve STEM education and increase the number of students pursuing STEM degrees. The DOE and its National Laboratories will manage some of these programs, marking a shift in their involvement in K-12 STEM education. The Administration has opposed some provisions related to these programs. The DOE and its National Laboratories will manage COMPETES Act programs, despite opposition from the Administration. Specialty schools in Math and Science, Experiential-based Learning Opportunities, Summer Institutes, and National Laboratories Centers of Excellence are contested as DOE responsibilities. Proponents argue that interacting with DOE scientists and engineers will inspire K-12 students in STEM education. Specialty schools aim to provide a high-quality STEM curriculum to improve academic achievement in science and mathematics. The Administration opposes DOE's involvement in establishing or expanding K-12 specialty schools in math and science. Supporters argue that such schools are crucial for attracting and inspiring top students and teachers. The America COMPETES Act authorizes summer internship programs at DOE national laboratories for middle and secondary school students in STEM fields. Proponents believe that these programs significantly enhance education quality. DOE National Laboratory Centers of Excellence in STEM education aim to assist teachers in high-need public secondary schools. The Administration opposes DOE's involvement in establishing or expanding K-12 specialty schools in math and science, believing it would divert resources from national laboratories. The America COMPETES Act reauthorizes STEM education programs at NSF and introduces a new program. The Administration opposes increased funding for the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program and the new Laboratory Science Pilot program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 emphasizes NSF's role in promoting quality math and science education. The Noyce Program under NSF promotes quality math and science education to support competitiveness in the 21st century. It emphasizes the importance of increasing highly qualified K-12 math and science teachers through scholarships for STEM students to become educators. An additional $5,000,000 is allocated for the Robert Noyce Scholarship program, totaling $15,000,000, to recruit and prepare undergraduate students in STEM fields to teach at elementary and secondary levels. The Noyce Program awards grants to higher education institutions to recruit and prepare undergraduate students majoring in STEM to become math and science teachers in K-12 schools. Students receive scholarships and stipends in exchange for teaching in high-need school districts. The program is based on successful models like UTeach and California Teach, involving master K-12 teachers in educating students. This approach is considered radical as it shifts from traditional teacher training methods. The Noyce Program aims to prepare STEM undergraduates for teaching careers in K-12 schools, challenging traditional views on education and emphasizing practical training for high-need fields. The program also supports the creation of professional science master's degree programs to meet industry workforce needs. The NSF Laboratory Science Pilot program aims to enhance STEM instruction by improving school laboratories and providing professional development for teachers. Approximately 120 Professional Science Master's programs offer advanced training in science or mathematics along with workplace skills highly valued by employers. These programs include academic training, internships, and cross-training in business and communications. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new programs in the Department of Education to improve STEM education, including the Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program aimed at increasing STEM teachers and the Math Now program to enhance math instruction. Schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students are less likely to have adequate laboratory facilities. The Math Now program aims to improve math instruction for elementary and middle school students by providing teachers with research-based tools and professional development. The America COMPETES Act includes provisions for the establishment of a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness, which led to the creation of a National Science and Technology Committee (NSTC) on Technology subcommittee. President Bush convened a National Science and Technology Summit in 2008 to examine the state of U.S. STEM enterprises. The Science and Technology Summit in 2008 examined the health and direction of U.S. STEM enterprises. The America COMPETES Act directed OSTP to develop principles for communication of data by federal scientists. The Bush Administration OSTP issued a memorandum emphasizing the importance of open communication of scientific information for advancing science and informing society. The Federal government is committed to a culture of scientific openness, fostering the exchange of ideas and information. NASA's science communications policy serves as a model for other agencies, allowing employees to speak to the press and public about their work. The America COMPETES Act designated actions for OSTP, including studies on barriers to innovation and coordination of research infrastructure. No action was taken by the Bush Administration on these initiatives. Dr. John Holdren's nomination as OSTP Director was confirmed on March 19, 2009. During his nomination hearing, he emphasized the importance of ensuring objective and accurate scientific and technical information is communicated to the President and Congress without censorship or distortion for ideological reasons. Dr. Holdren emphasized the importance of ensuring scientific integrity in the federal government, following the America Competes Act to prevent censorship or distortion of research findings. President Obama assigned OSTP the responsibility for maintaining integrity in all executive aspects.

The America COMPETES Act aims to enhance U.S. competitiveness through research and development. The act focuses on maintaining the country's top ranking in international competitiveness, despite increasing science and technology investments by other nations. Evaluation mechanisms assess competitiveness by comparing the U.S. with other countries using various indicators. It is important to note that there are no direct measures of innovation or competitiveness. The importance of various indicators in assessing innovation and competitiveness is discussed. It is noted that there are no direct measures for these factors, and innovation can occur regardless of research and development due to market demand or minor alterations in existing products. The role of the federal government, industrial sector, and universities in innovation is highlighted. The federal government, industrial sector, and universities play a major role in funding R&D and innovation. Innovation measures often focus on research and development funding without differentiating between the two. University-industry cooperation is critical in bridging basic research and industry. Non-defense R&D funding may provide a different perspective on innovation. Industry R&D investment nature, such as research versus development funding and sector allocation, is an important factor to consider. The nature of R&D investment is crucial, with varying funding allocations across different industrial sectors. Patent data may not fully capture innovation, as not all outcomes are patentable. The number of scientists and engineers may not directly reflect a nation's innovative capacity. Government policy aims to create an environment conducive to innovation and competitiveness. The policy focuses on creating an environment for innovation to thrive, ensuring competitiveness with other nations. Monitoring and assessing the impact of U.S. policies is crucial for making adjustments. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness plays a key role in monitoring, advising on global trends, identifying opportunities, and developing metrics to measure progress in promoting innovation. The policy aims to improve innovation conditions by evaluating research and education programs, such as ARPA-E and Discovery Science Institutes. Federal research programs are assessed based on quality, relevance, and performance. Merit-based processes determine funding for research activities and education programs like DOE summer institutes. The DOE summer institutes and STEM education programs are required to report on their impact on improving STEM teaching skills, increasing the number of STEM teachers, and enhancing student academic achievement. Grants for STEM baccalaureate and Master's programs must evaluate their effectiveness in increasing new STEM teachers in high-need schools and promoting diversity in STEM teaching. Annual independent evaluations are authorized to assess the impact on student academic achievement. The U.S. government utilizes various mechanisms to monitor and evaluate competitiveness, including the WEF Global Competitiveness Report and the OECD Science, Technology and Industry Scoreboard. These reports provide insights on innovation, trade competitiveness, and productivity based on input and output indicators. Examples of output indicators include economic trade balance, foreign direct investment, employment, and wages. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), U.S. Census Bureau, and National Science Foundation monitor output indicators like economic trade balance, foreign direct investment, employment, and wages. The NSF releases a biannual Science and Engineering Indicators report that compiles this information. Input indicators include quality of education, availability of STEM workforce, and innovation capacity. These indicators help identify policy areas for the U.S. to focus on relative to its competitors. The United States needs to focus on policy areas relative to its competitors, as indicated by input/output indicators like quality of education and innovation capacity. The America COMPETES Act programs are linked to key sub-indicators such as quality of primary education, capacity for innovation, and availability of scientists and engineers. State-level competitiveness analysis is also available, with factors influenced by the Act.
