    "content": "The President signed the final version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 on July 29, 2010, which includes $59.2 billion in spending for various purposes. The bill was passed by both the House and Senate, with the House receding from an amended version. The enacted bill provides $58.8 billion in new Budget Authority, with rescissions and mandatory savings offsetting some of the spending. The House debated H.Con.Res. 301, which would require the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Pakistan within 30 days. The resolution was defeated, and the Senate disagreed with the House's amended version of H.R. 4899. The House amended version of H.R. 4899 was adopted on July 22, 2010, after a failed cloture vote. The Senate opposed the House version, leading to the adoption of the Senate version with $59.2 billion for war funding, Haiti relief, and new benefits for Vietnam veterans. The House dropped support for the House version due to concerns about Army funding running out in August. The Senate version of H.R. 4899, passed by a vote of 67 to 28, includes $59.2 billion for wars, Haiti relief, FEMA, and new VA benefits. The debate revolved around additional domestic spending proposals and the Administration's new war policy in Afghanistan. Representative David Obey introduced the Senate version for House consideration, adding funds for FEMA disaster funding, war funding, teacher job losses, Pell fund shortfalls, and border security. The House debated the Senate version of H.R. 4899, which included funding for wars, Haiti relief, FEMA, and new VA benefits. Representative Obey introduced the bill with additional funds for FEMA disaster funding, war funding, teacher job losses, Pell fund shortfalls, and border security. Representative Obey opposed the bill due to lack of support from Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the absence of a proposed House amendment. Other members supported DOD's war funding and disaster assistance. The House debated H.R. 4899, which included funding for wars, Haiti relief, FEMA, and new VA benefits.

The resolution was defeated by 38 to 372, and the Senate failed to adopt cloture on the House version of H.R. 4899. The final version of H.R. 4899 appropriates $59.2 billion in spending, $5.0 billion below the request, matching or close to the Administration's request for various funds. In the final version of H.R. 4899, the total funding closely matches the Administration's request for various funds, including $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Assistance Fund, $13.4 billion for Vietnam veterans affected by Agent Orange, and $30.8 billion for the Department of Defense war-related funding. Congress made adjustments in individual accounts, with notable differences in funding for war-related foreign aid, settlement of court cases, border security, and other foreign aid and humanitarian assistance. Additional funding was allocated for flood and drought relief, while some requests were not included in the final version. In the final version of H.R. 4899, Congress did not include additional domestic funding for various programs like teacher layoffs prevention, Pell grants, summer jobs, and agricultural and energy grants. The bill also did not include $600 million for border security and $129 million to reduce patent backlogs. Separate bills were passed for this funding. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212 includes $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for the Afghan and Iraq wars. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212 provides $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for the Afghan and Iraq wars. $31.5 billion is allocated for the Afghan war, with $29.8 billion for DOD and $1.7 billion for State/USAID programs. For the Iraq war, $2.7 billion is allocated, including $1.0 billion for DOD and $1.7 billion for State/USAID programs. Total funding for the Afghan and Iraq wars, including previous appropriations and VA medical costs, amounts to $169.9 billion. This includes $104.4 billion for the Afghan war and $65.5 billion for the Iraq war. Additional non-war funding for DOD and foreign aid for Pakistan is also included in the legislation. Between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010, Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010. The House passed H.R. 4899 with $5.1 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund and $600 million for the Department of Labor's summer jobs program. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 with $59.2 billion for various purposes including disaster relief, war funding, Haiti relief, and additional benefits for Vietnam veterans. The House adopted the Senate's version of H.R. 4899 and added funds for the Education Jobs Fund and Pell Grants. Between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010, Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010. The House passed H.R. 4899 with $5.1 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund and $600 million for the Department of Labor's summer jobs program. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 with $59.2 billion for various purposes including disaster relief, war funding, Haiti relief, and additional benefits for Vietnam veterans. The House adopted the Senate's version of H.R. 4899 with $58.9 billion in new BA and $380 million in offsetting rescissions. Additional funds were added for the Education Jobs Fund, Pell Grants, summer youth employment, funding for court cases, with a total of $81.8 billion in spending. The bill was signed into law on July 29, 2010. Disaster Assistance Funds were allocated for Haiti earthquake recovery, border security enhancement, and court case settlements for American Indians and black farmers in the FY2010 supplemental requests. This included funds for the U.S. Disaster Relief Fund, Defense Department deployment, foreign assistance for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, Haiti reconstruction, compensation for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, responses to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, additional border security personnel, and settlements for American Indian land trust claims and black farmer discrimination claims. The Senate and House debated the impact of this spending on the federal deficit. The Senate and House debated the impact of supplemental spending on the federal deficit in the Pigford II case. Different versions of H.R. 4899 included varying amounts of rescissions and mandatory savings to offset proposed spending, with the final version including $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings to offset $81.8 billion in spending. The effect on the deficit depends on the net amount of new Budget Authority (BA) needed for each version. The final version of H.R. 4899 included $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings to offset $81.8 billion in spending. Almost all discretionary spending was designated as emergency, not counting against budget caps. The President's supplemental request included $46.3 billion in discretionary spending and $18.1 billion in mandatory spending. The Administration submitted emergency supplemental appropriations requests to Congress as part of the FY2011 budget. Some see these requests as undermining budgetary discipline and receiving less scrutiny than regular appropriations. Congress debates whether to increase spending above the appropriated levels for the year and subsequent years. Members are concerned about the impact of additional spending on the deficit. Congress may debate increasing spending above appropriated levels for the year and subsequent years. If additional spending is deemed necessary, Congress must decide whether to increase the budget deficit or offset it by cutting federal spending or increasing revenues. This decision is made within budget rules and procedures, such as the FY2010 budget resolution and congressional pay-as-you-go rules. Congress could exempt spending by designating it as an emergency or waiving applicable points of order. During consideration of H.R. 4899 from late March to late July 2010, various agencies and plaintiffs cited deadlines for supplemental funding needed, with some flexibility in dates. An emergency designation could exempt spending from budget rules, but could still be subject to a point of order that may be waived in both houses by specific procedures. In June 2010, Admiral Thad Allen and Secretary Janet Napolitano urged Congress to raise the cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities due to concerns about insufficient funding for Federal response operations within two weeks. The House and Senate passed a bill to raise the annual cap to address this issue. The House and Senate passed S. 3473, P.L. 111-191, on June 9 and June 20, 2010, raising the annual cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to $1 billion specifically for the Deepwater Horizon Spill. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in bridge funds for war funding, with additional funding needed for troops deploying to Afghanistan. The Army, Navy, and USMC could cover war operations through August 2010. Secretary of Defense Gates urged passage of war funding by July 4 to avoid disruptions in programs. Funding from the base budget may run out in August, leading to disruptive actions. In early to mid-August, there is a risk of running out of funds in the base budget, leading to furloughs for civilians and potential payment issues for active duty military. The Army and Marine Corps could rely on already appropriated war bridge funds through August, with the Army having sufficient funds through mid-August according to Under Secretary Joseph Westphal's testimony. The Army and Marine Corps could rely on already appropriated war bridge funds through August, with the services tapping into base budget funding temporarily to finance war funding. FEMA also took measures to make the Disaster Relief Fund last longer, but estimated it would become insolvent by the end of June. FEMA estimated the Disaster Relief Fund would become insolvent by the end of June 2010, but as of June 7, 2010, the fund had a balance of $952 million. This was due to FEMA's policy of only paying for projects meeting immediate needs, ensuring funds were available for urgent situations. Despite a backlog of $1.4 billion in projects, the fund could last another three months if spending continued at $350 million per month. The State Department needed its disaster assistance funding replenished by June 1, 2010, to maintain capacity for future humanitarian crises. In order to respond to future humanitarian crises, disaster assistance funding needed to be replenished by June 1, 2010. Congress did not enact the $1.15 billion appropriation by the mid-April 2010 deadline to settle the Pigford II court case. The latest deadline for Congress to approve the settlement of the Cobell suit for government mismanagement of funds and lands held in trust for individual American Indians is August 6, 2010. Members of Congress raised issues regarding continued spending on the Afghan War and preventing corruption during consideration of the FY2010 supplemental. During consideration of the FY2010 supplemental, Congress discussed setting a timeline for evaluating spending on the Afghan War, preventing corruption in foreign aid for Afghanistan and Iraq, monitoring Haiti relief funds, and determining if additional domestic spending needed to be offset to prevent increasing the deficit. The Administration requested $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund due to anticipated shortages by May or June 2010. FEMA projected the Disaster Relief Fund would run out by May or June 2010, prompting measures to limit expenditures and delay payments for certain projects. Congress questioned FEMA's budgeting practices and why disaster relief funds were not requested earlier. Concerns were raised about the timing and scope of compensation. In its budget blueprint, the Obama Administration criticized previous administrations for unrealistic budgeting practices. The FY2010 request for the Disaster Relief Fund was $2.0 billion, but Congress provided $1.6 billion. The FY2011 request is $1.9 billion, citing 59 disasters in 2009 and 18 in 2010. Additional funding is needed for arbitration rulings, including those related to Hurricane Katrina. Regular requests have been insufficient to meet needs. Higher levels of funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) may be necessary to address the devastation caused by Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. Congress may need to consider funding the DRF at a higher level to avoid the need for supplemental funding in the future. FEMA provided limited information to justify the need for supplementing the DRF, with only one example of an arbitration ruling awarding $475 million to the Charity Hospital in New Orleans. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) and includes additional funding for various disaster relief projects, such as floods in Tennessee, fishery disasters in Alaska, and tornado damages in the Midwest. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the timeliness of information provided by OMB regarding disaster relief funding requirements. The Senate Appropriations Committee criticized the delay in OMB's information on disaster relief funding requirements. The FY2011 request is expected to be $1-2 billion short for previous disasters like Hurricane Katrina. H.R. 4899 includes funding for various agencies for disaster relief activities, such as $100 million for HUD, $227 million for Army Corps of Engineers, $49 million for Commerce Department, and $18 million for Agriculture Department's emergency forest restoration program. The final version of H.R. 4899 includes $49 million for the Agriculture Department's emergency forest restoration program. It also directs FEMA to create an interagency taskforce to address community concerns related to flood maps updates. The DOD and State Department/USAID FY2010 supplemental requests provide funding for deploying additional troops to Afghanistan and economic assistance. The Obama Administration requested a $33 billion supplemental appropriation for FY2010 to deploy 30,000 troops to Afghanistan. The Obama Administration requested a $33 billion supplemental appropriation for FY2010 to deploy 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, aiming to reverse the deteriorating security situation and \"break the Taliban's momentum.\" By June 1, almost 94,000 troops were in Afghanistan, with the remainder of the 30,000 increase expected by September 2010. This would triple the number of U.S. troops deployed in October 2008. Bush increased troops in Afghanistan in response to security concerns, reaching 46,000 in May 2009. Obama approved additional increases, bringing total troops to 98,000 by fall 2009. NATO allies also increased troops to 48,000 by March 2010. Plans aim for 148,000 foreign troops and 243,000 Afghan security forces, totaling 389,000. The Defense Department requested $33 billion for troop support, Iraq Security Forces training, and fuel costs. In FY2010, DOD war spending increased to $160 billion, with $99 billion for Afghanistan and $61 billion for Iraq. Total war funding for Afghanistan reached $314.1 billion with the FY2010 Supplemental. The total for Iraq was $706.2 billion with the Supplemental. If the FY2011 request is approved, the total war funding would rise to $427.7 billion for Afghanistan and $752 billion for Iraq. These figures exclude war funding for State/USAID and VA Medical. President Obama approved a new deployment in Afghanistan with a timeline for beginning the transfer of forces out in July 2011, subject to review in December 2010. Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Mullen cautioned that the July 2011 date is for transitioning, not leaving, based on conditions on the ground. General Petraeus described the initiative as an 18-month campaign to be evaluated in September. The U.S. Central Command initiated an 18-month campaign in Afghanistan, to be evaluated in September 2011. Members of Congress raised concerns about the timing and length of the campaign, with three amendments debated and rejected to increase congressional participation in decision-making. Amendment No. 3 proposed cutting off all funding for Afghanistan, Amendment No. 4 aimed to limit DOD funding to troop withdrawal, and Amendment No. 5 required a new National Intelligence Estimate and a timetable for troop redeployment. The U.S. began withdrawing troops from Afghanistan after July 1, 2011, following the President's announcement in December 2009. Concerns arose during operations in Marjah and plans for Kandahar. A $33 billion DOD supplemental request included $30 billion for Afghanistan operations. The $33 billion DOD supplemental request included $19 billion for \"Operations\" such as Military Personnel and Operation and Maintenance costs, $3.3 billion for force protection, $2.6 billion for Afghan security forces training, and various other allocations for military intelligence, national intelligence, and military construction. Some policymakers estimated the cost of deploying 30,000 more troops at $1 million per troop. DOD developed functional categories for funding, including \"Operations\" and Coalition Support Funds for Pakistan. Funding for different categories increased at rates ranging from 123% for Operations to 35% for Coalition Support. DOD estimates for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan differ from CBO's estimates, with DOD's per troop cost at $875,000 compared to CBO's $467,000. Both DOD and CBO assume the same average monthly troop strength. The FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act transferred $5 billion of DOD's request for Operation and Maintenance funding to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund due to concerns about accurate budgeting for the Afghan and Iraq wars. DOD's estimates for deploying troops to southern Afghanistan may be high, as indicated by obligations reported in the first five months of FY2010. DOD's FY2010 request for additional funds raised concerns about the accuracy of their estimates. Obligations for operational costs in the first five months were lower than expected, leading to questions about the need for the requested $2.6 billion for training and Afghan Security Forces Fund. The approval of this request increased the total ASFF funding to $9.2 billion, prompting concerns about oversight and the achievability of DOD's plans. The new plan aims to increase Afghan Security forces to 243,000 by October 2010 and 305,600 by FY2011. The Afghan Army would grow to 171,000 by October 2011, and the Afghan Police to 134,000. Concerns were raised about the necessity of DOD's FY2010 supplemental request of $2.6 billion for sustaining growth and providing infrastructure and equipment. The DOD has requested $14.2 billion for Afghan Security Forces in FY2010 and FY2011, bringing the total to $39.8 billion. General McChrystal proposed increasing Afghan Army and Police to 400,000, but this goal is not endorsed by the Obama Administration. Training is managed by DOD and State Department, with U.S. military personnel, NATO teams, and contractors involved. The training of Afghan security forces is carried out by U.S. military personnel, NATO coalition teams, and private contractors. However, there have been numerous problems including attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, logistical limitations, and corruption. The training for Afghan police has been hindered by illiteracy, corruption, and attacks by insurgents. Various reports have highlighted difficulties in coordinating training efforts, problems with private contractors, and a lack of oversight in managing contracts. The training of Afghan security forces faces challenges such as attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, and corruption. Senator Levin expressed concerns about a shortfall in trainers for the Afghan army and police, with only 44% of required trainers currently assigned. Questions arise about the number of trainers needed, how the requirement will be met, and the potential impact on DOD funding if personnel are not available as anticipated. The availability of trainers for Afghan security forces is a concern due to potential shortfalls that could impact DOD funding. Delays in contract awards and uncertainties in training plans have raised questions about funding allocation. DOD still has nearly $3.6 billion in funding from FY2009 and FY2010, with the rate of fund obligation suggesting an additional six months of availability. In FY2010, DOD obligated funds at a rate of $540 million a month, raising questions about the necessity of emergency war supplementals. DOD's original FY2010 request was included in the DOD Appropriations Act. Some argue for an emergency designation due to troop deployment changes. Congressional decision-making is crucial in determining emergency spending. Some of DOD's requests, like funding for Iraqi Security Forces and fuel increases, are under scrutiny. Some of DOD's requests, such as $1 billion for training in the Iraqi Security Forces Fund and $2 billion to offset fuel increases, may not be clearly related to new deployments and could be part of DOD's regular FY2011 appropriation request. Congress has become less willing to fund Iraqi security forces due to the turnover of security responsibility to the Iraqi government and rising oil prices. DOD argues that the funding is necessary for modernization efforts and to ensure Iraq's security, but the emergency designation could be challenged. DOD has financed increases in fuel prices using cash resources or transferring funds from less urgent needs. An infusion of budget authority is needed for additional troops. $1.7 billion is requested for equipment reset. The enacted H.R. 4899 provided $32.9 billion to DOD, $148 million less than requested, with adjustments for excess funding, fuel pricing changes, and combat. The enacted H.R. 4899 provided $32.9 billion to DOD, $148 million less than requested, with adjustments for excess funding, fuel pricing changes, and combat losses. This includes cuts to military personnel, operation and maintenance, force protection programs, and an increase to procurement accounts. Both the House and Senate versions approved funding for training Afghan and Iraq security forces. The final version of the bill approved funding for training Afghan and Iraq security forces. It also included a requirement for intelligence committees to receive threat assessments from Guantanamo detainees. However, a provision for $300 million for base closure transportation improvements was dropped. The Administration requested $529 million for military construction, including $521 million for Afghanistan. This raises concerns about whether DOD is building temporary facilities or permanent bases in Afghanistan. Congress allowed spending for a \"long-term presence\" but prohibited spending for \"permanent stationing\" of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The Administration requested $521 million for military construction in Afghanistan to create infrastructure for 30,000 additional U.S. troops. The request aims to expand airfield and logistics capacity in key locations, with projects split between Army and Air Force construction. Army projects focus on southern and northern provinces, while Air Force construction is planned for various locations. The military construction in Afghanistan aims to create infrastructure for 30,000 additional U.S. troops. Projects include expanding airfield and logistics capacity in key locations, such as Nimruz, Balkh, and Herand provinces. Army construction focuses on waste management, fuel storage, gravel roads, and command headquarters in Helmand. Air Force projects include runway and apron construction at various Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) across the country. The military construction in Afghanistan aims to create infrastructure for additional U.S. troops, including expanding airfield and logistics capacity in key locations. Congress has expressed concerns about long-term troop commitments and has adopted language to prevent the establishment of permanent bases in Afghanistan. The FY2009 Supplemental Appropriation prohibits the establishment of permanent military bases in Afghanistan but allows for funding of facilities supporting a \"long-term presence.\" The distinction between the two types of projects is unclear, leading to uncertainty in funding decisions. Some projects in supplemental appropriations requests for military facilities in Afghanistan have faced funding challenges due to uncertainty over their long-term purpose. Congress has restricted funds for projects signaling a permanent presence, while allowing for facilities supporting a \"long-term presence.\" DOD has been granted flexibility to use O&M funds for temporary military operational requirements since FY2004. The US military is expected to have a long-term presence in Afghanistan, with Congress allowing the use of O&M funds for construction projects to meet urgent military requirements. This funding has significantly increased the amount spent on military construction in the region. In FY2009, DOD allocated $409 million from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan, adding to the $900 million appropriated, totaling $1.4 billion. This amount nearly matched the total spent on construction in Afghanistan from FY2003 to FY2008. DOD's construction investment in Afghanistan doubled in FY2009 alone. If the full $500 million in O&M is used for military construction in Afghanistan in FY2010, the total would reach $2.4 billion, almost doubling the prior seven-year investment. DOD has proposed using O&M funds for minor construction in support of contingency operations until October 1, 2012. The investment in key bases, such as $1.3 billion in Bagram Air Base, reflects DOD's commitment in Afghanistan. The DOD has invested significant amounts in key bases in Afghanistan, including $1.3 billion in Bagram Air Base, $767 million in Kandahar Air Base, and $595 million in Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion. There is a proposal to allow the use of O&M funds for unspecified minor military construction projects up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations until September 30, 2012. This would increase the per project cap from $750,000 to $3 million to account for rising construction costs in Afghanistan. The DOD proposed increasing the cap for minor construction projects to $3 million due to rising costs in Afghanistan. This would allow unlimited O&M funds for military construction worldwide. Quarterly reporting to Congress would be after-the-fact, raising questions about the urgency of a $521 million supplemental request given DOD's current spending rates. In FY2009, DOD obligated $607 million for military construction projects in Afghanistan, averaging $50 million a month. The average fell to $26 million a month in the first five months of FY2010. To obligate all $2.1 billion available by the end of the fiscal year, DOD would need to increase monthly obligations six-fold to $300 million. $700 million must be obligated by September 30, 2010, and $1.4 billion by September 30, 2011. DOD would need to increase its monthly obligation rate four-fold to $100 million in the second half of FY2009 to spend all funds before they lapse. Monthly obligations for FY2010 projects would need to average $116 million, or more than four times the current rate. Additional supplemental funds would require monthly obligations to triple from the FY2009 rate to $150 million. The FY2010 supplemental request for military construction projects in Afghanistan totaled $657 million, including $649 million for war-related construction and $8 million for non war-related projects. The Senate added $127.5 million above the request to accelerate Air Force projects for FY2011. The additional funds were aimed at addressing contingency-related projects. The Senate added funds for contingency-related military construction projects, available until September 30, 2011. The final bill did not include funds for a new Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, TX. The Administration's FY2010 Supplemental request addressed foreign economic assistance for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The Administration's FY2010 Supplemental request for foreign economic assistance in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan totaled $4.46 billion, with $1.8 billion allocated to the State Department for personnel and infrastructure. The request aimed to support U.S. security, economic growth, social services, and democratization objectives in these countries. Funding was not requested for certain aid programs like P.L.480 food aid and Global Health/Child Survival. The Administration's FY2010 Supplemental request for foreign economic assistance in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan totaled $4.46 billion, with $1.8 billion allocated to the State Department for personnel and infrastructure. The request aimed to support U.S. security, economic growth, social services, and democratization objectives in these countries. The Administration only requested funding in discrete sub-accounts that address certain needs, excluding P.L.480 food aid and Global Health/Child Survival. The enacted version of the FY2010 supplemental provided a total international affairs war-related foreign aid and diplomatic operations funding at $3.7 billion, $714 million less than the Administration request. The U.S. military's efforts in Afghanistan have been accompanied by social services, with a focus on strengthening civilian presence and increasing aid to local government. The \"surge\" strategy in December 2009 accelerated the need for civilian assistance delivery, particularly in insurgent areas. The strategy aims to increase stability and reduce insurgency by creating jobs and providing social services through the Afghan government. Concerns include the Afghan government's ability to provide leadership and support, coordination between military and civilian aid programs, and levels of corruption. The U.S. military and civilian aid programs in Afghanistan are facing challenges due to high levels of corruption in the Afghan government. Concerns about accountability and monitoring of aid programs have led to an increase in U.S. aid personnel and requests for inspector general oversight. The Afghanistan supplemental request aims to boost U.S. international affairs funding for the country, with a significant increase in State Department diplomatic operations account in FY2010. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 increases total FY2010 aid levels by 55% over the previous year. The Administration sought $1.6 billion in Economic Support Funds (ESF) and $200 million in International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funding. ESF is a main source of economic, political, and social aid, mostly channeled through USAID, with allocations for alternative development and rule of law. The enacted H.R. 4899 increases FY2010 aid levels by 55%. Funding includes $216 million for conflict mitigation, $760 million for good governance, $50 million for health and education, $7 million for macroeconomic growth, $19.5 million for trade and investment, $4.5 million for the financial sector, and $215 million for agriculture. The INCLE account, implemented by the State Department, includes funding for various sectors such as agriculture, private sector development, and economic opportunities. The request also includes support for the justice sector, with a focus on rule of law activities and counter-narcotics programs. This funding will be used for expanding credit union services, Islamic-compliant financing, corrections programs, model prisons, increasing the number of judges and prosecutors, counternarcotics police, and drug treatment facilities. The FY2010 State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) request of $211 million aimed to support ongoing and proposed international affairs assistance programs. It included a 457 position increase for civilian personnel, with 212 U.S. direct hires at the district level and funding for 245 staff to work with Kabul ministries and Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs). The hiring of about 200 locally employed staff (LES) was also proposed to provide support to American personnel in the field. The FY2010 State Department requested $211 million for international affairs assistance programs, including a proposal to hire 200 locally employed staff to support American personnel. The expansion of staff in Kabul raised concerns about resource strain, management, and security needs. Additional funding was requested for oversight programs. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Afghanistan foreign aid and diplomatic operations, cutting the ESF request by $267 million. The Senate report recommends specific funding levels for program sectors within the ESF account, expressing concerns about providing aid directly to the government of Afghanistan. The INCLE account was also cut by $31 million due to concerns. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 limits direct government budget support to $100 million and cuts the INCLE account by $31 million due to concerns about the weak and corrupt justice system in Afghanistan. It also addresses oversight issues by rejecting the request for SIGAR and includes conditions on aid, such as consultation with Afghan government representatives and civil society, and measuring progress by specific benchmarks. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 sets conditions for aid to Afghanistan, including cooperation in reform efforts, respect for women's rights, and removal of corrupt officials. Aid for the Electoral Commission is contingent on no involvement in fraud, and support for reconciliation with Taliban members requires women's participation and protection of their rights. Up to $300 million in funding can be transferred for civilian security activities in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The FY2010 supplemental funding for Iraq saw a significant increase in U.S. assistance and State Department operations following the drawdown of U.S. military forces. The total economic aid program to Iraq rose by 64% under the request, and by 89% with the enacted version of H.R. 4899. The State operations account increased by 79% under the request, but only by 43% in the enacted legislation. The most significant element was the request for $517.4 million in INCLE funds. The FY2010 supplemental funding for Iraq included a significant increase in U.S. assistance and State Department operations, with a focus on transitioning police training responsibilities from the Department of Defense to the Department of State. This involved deploying 350 advisors to work with the Ministry and police forces, as well as funding infrastructure and security staff. The INCLE program is expected to employ up to 2,000 U.S. government and contractor personnel. The FY2010 supplemental funding for Iraq included a significant increase in U.S. assistance and State Department operations, with a focus on transitioning police training responsibilities from the Department of Defense to the Department of State. The INCLE program is expected to employ up to 2,000 U.S. government and contractor personnel, with funding for aircraft and expanded aviation facilities to facilitate staff travel. The funding also covers State Department operational costs under the D&CP account, amounting to $1.57 billion, to maintain civilian outreach to the provinces following the U.S. military drawdown. Currently, over 1,200 direct-hire American employees from 14 civilian agencies are stationed in Iraq, conducting business on various missions. The FY2010 supplemental funding for Iraq included increased U.S. assistance and State Department operations, focusing on transitioning police training responsibilities. Over 1,200 American employees from 14 civilian agencies are stationed in Iraq, conducting various missions. Embedded Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) support reconstruction efforts and are being phased out as combat battalions withdraw. The State Department plans to establish two consulates and three Provincial Diplomatic Teams (PDTs) to maintain a civilian presence outside of Baghdad. The supplemental funding request for Iraq includes realigning infrastructure for the presence of an Embassy, consulates, and PDTs. The State Department will assume costs previously borne by the military, such as utilities, housing, and security requirements, totaling $1.57 billion. This transition will also involve construction development for consulate facilities and increased contract employees for various services. The Department of Defense will need to increase contract employees to provide various services for housing, protecting, and maintaining its staff. There are concerns about the Department's ability to manage and oversee these contracts as its responsibilities in Iraq grow. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Iraq, $407 million less than the request. The Senate appropriators cut $540 million from the request for diplomatic operations, with $527 million intended for consulate construction in Iraq. The enacted H.R. 4899 increased INCLE funding by $133 million, reallocating funds for police training. The Pakistan supplemental request showed no significant policy changes. The Administration's FY2010 supplemental request for Pakistan aimed at specific infrastructure needs to show continued U.S. support. The largest portion of the request was for $244 million in ESF, including funds for cash payments, water and sanitation, agriculture irrigation, and energy solutions. Additionally, $40 million in INCLE funds were included for police training and related infrastructure. The Administration's FY2010 supplemental request for Pakistan included $40 million in INCLE funds for police training and related infrastructure, as well as $60 million in Foreign Military Financing for Bell-412 utility helicopters. Additionally, $26 million was requested for State Department operations to increase staffing at U.S. diplomatic facilities in Pakistan. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $375 million for Pakistan aid and diplomatic operations, with increased staffing at U.S. diplomatic facilities in Pakistan and funds directed specifically to human rights programs. The enacted legislation includes $15 million more than the request for ESF, with $5 million for human rights and $10 million for families affected by military operations in Pakistan. $1.5 million in ESF is allocated for leasing aircraft for monitoring programs. The Obama Administration requested $2.8 billion in FY2010 supplemental funding for Haiti relief and reconstruction after the earthquake. About 55% of the funds are available until September 30, 2012. The Haiti supplemental request includes reimbursement for relief activities and new recovery efforts. The earthquake affected 3 million people, with 230,000 deaths and 300,600 injured. The relief effort is expected to last for months, and Haiti was already designated as one of the 50 least developed countries prior to the earthquake. Protection of the displaced population is a critical issue. The displaced population in Haiti, estimated at 1.69 million in Port-au-Prince, is in urgent need of protection and aid. Many have relocated to poverty-stricken areas lacking basic services. Aid workers are delivering necessities to Internally Displaced Populations, but emergency shelter is scarce. Providing waterproof shelter, sanitation, and meeting basic needs are top priorities as the rainy and hurricane seasons approach. The Haiti Post Disaster Needs Assessment found that $11.5 billion is needed for recovery and reconstruction efforts. At a donors conference, $10 billion was pledged by 48 countries and organizations, with the U.S. pledging $1.2 billion. Improved accountability of donor assistance is emphasized to reduce corruption. Haiti has made progress in reducing corruption and increasing transparency, qualifying for debt relief. The U.S. Agency for International Development has helped establish an online monitoring system for donor pledges and assistance spending. The U.S. Agency for International Development has assisted Haiti in establishing an online system to monitor donor pledges and assistance spending. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $2.93 billion for Haiti, $129 million more than the request. The funding covers relief activities, recovery and reconstruction, and diplomatic operations. The Administration requested $1.5 billion for relief and disaster assistance funding for Haiti. The $1.5 billion request for Haiti included funding for USAID International Disaster Assistance, Agriculture Department emergency food assistance, State Department peacekeeping activities, Department of Defense, U.S. Coast Guard relief activities, Department of Health and Human Services grants for Haitian evacuees, and Department of Homeland Security immigration fees. President Obama announced an additional $100 million in humanitarian assistance. As of June 11, 2010, the U.S. had provided over $1.1 billion in humanitarian funding for Haiti. The United States provided earthquake relief to Haiti through interagency agreements, with IDA funding covering various support services totaling $35.6 million. The remaining $188.5 million of the IDA request went towards ongoing humanitarian assistance activities. Relief efforts in Haiti were organized into twelve clusters, with funding targeting programs such as humanitarian coordination, logistics, shelter, health, water, sanitation, and child protection. The request for earthquake relief in Haiti included funding for various programs such as food assistance, health, water, sanitation, and child protection. It is estimated that up to two million people may need food assistance. Relief operations will continue through 2010, with a focus on targeting the most vulnerable and implementing food-for-work programs. As recovery and reconstruction progress, activities will address both humanitarian concerns and reconstruction efforts. In the recovery and reconstruction phase of the supplemental request, humanitarian concerns will be addressed. Haiti has experienced numerous natural disasters, mainly hurricanes, in the past decade. The international community, including the United Nations and the United States, has provided significant humanitarian assistance. It is crucial to develop a disaster response capacity to minimize humanitarian consequences and sustain reconstruction efforts. The United States is a leader in providing relief efforts for humanitarian disasters. The Administration may deplete disaster accounts to fund immediate relief efforts, impacting U.S. capacity to respond to other emergencies if not replenished by June 1, 2010. The United Nations has appealed for $1.44 billion for Haiti, with $874 million committed as of June 4, 2010. Donor pledges may not always translate into actual contributions for relief efforts. The international response to the Haiti disaster has faced challenges, with pledges not always resulting in actual contributions. It will take time to determine how costs will be shared among donors. Sustaining donor interest and honoring pledges could be difficult as Haiti stabilizes. Criticisms have been raised about the slow delivery of aid, attributed to the weakened capacity of the Haitian government and logistical challenges. The challenges of managing massive aid influx in a city destroyed by an earthquake have caused delays and difficulties on the ground. Evaluations of the relief response in Haiti are ongoing, with concerns about bureaucratic red tape, Haitian government capacity, and coordination issues among international actors. The DOD and U.S. Coast Guard requested funds for humanitarian relief efforts in Operation Unified Response. The DOD's response to the Haitian earthquake in Operation Unified Response was rapid and extensive, with over 20,000 U.S. military personnel involved in transporting supplies, evacuating people, providing security, and conducting humanitarian projects. The mission ended on June 1, 2010, when the last 300 personnel redeployed from Haiti. The response mission in Haiti ended on June 1, 2010, with the withdrawal of the last 300 U.S. military personnel. Despite this, the U.S. commitment to Haiti continues through the \"New Horizons\" annual humanitarian exercise involving National Guard and Reserve soldiers. Concerns have been raised about the premature withdrawal of U.S. forces and the capabilities of Haitian security forces and U.N. personnel. The Administration requested $96.5 million for the State Department's Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) account to fund U.S. assessed contributions to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), a peacekeeping operation. The U.N. Security Council increased MINUSTAH levels by 3,500 after the earthquake, with military personnel growing from 6,940 to 8,940 and the police component growing from 2,211 to 3,711. Additionally, on June 4, 2010, the Security Council increased the police component by another 680 to provide \"temporary surge capacity,\" raising the ceiling on the number of police in MINUSTAH to 4,391. The Administration requested $256.2 million for relief and reconstruction aid in Haiti, including funds for Haitian evacuees and migrants to the United States. The request includes $220.0 million for HHS activities and $36.2 million for USAID to reimburse HHS. The $220.0 million would fund Medicaid and CHIP costs, medical evacuations, assistance for evacuees, and public health activities in Haiti. Funding allocation for each activity was not specified in the request. The request for supplemental funds includes payment of state share of Medicaid and CHIP costs for eligible medical and non-medical evacuees, reimbursement for medical evacuation of seriously injured earthquake victims to the United States, and funding for HHS public health activities in Haiti. The request did not specify funding allocation or proposed changes in eligibility for assistance. The requested funds will be used for medical evacuation and care of seriously injured earthquake victims from Haiti to the United States. NDMS will reimburse hospitals for 30 days of care for evacuated individuals, regardless of citizenship. Funds will also support cash and medical assistance for Haitian humanitarian parolees, eligible for federal resettlement assistance. Requested funds will be used for medical evacuation and care of seriously injured earthquake victims from Haiti to the United States. Additionally, funds will support cash and medical assistance for Haitian humanitarian parolees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Public health activities in Haiti, such as disease surveillance and reestablishment of laboratory capacity, will also be supported. The NDMS system was used to airlift Haitian earthquake victims to the US for medical care, requiring rapid policy development. The President's supplemental request included $15 million for USCIS to cover immigration-related costs for Haitian migrants. USCIS funds processing through fees generated by the Examinations Fee Account. USCIS charges fees for adjudications and services, including Temporary Protected Status (TPS) applications. For FY2010, USCIS has a budget of $2.727 billion, with $2.503 billion from collected fees. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act 2010 provided $224 million in direct appropriations to USCIS, including $50 million for processing refugee and asylum claims. The Administration proposed using $15 million in supplemental appropriations to reimburse USCIS for waived fees for eligible Haitians granted TPS and for processing adoption of Haitian orphans. The final version of the appropriations bill provides $110 million above the request for humanitarian assistance in Haiti, totaling $460 million. It also includes funding for P.L. 480-Title II assistance, Department of Defense, Coast Guard operations in Haiti, Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities, and services for Haitian evacuees and migrants. Additionally, $10.6 million is approved for USCIS costs associated with processing TPS applications and adoption of Haitian orphans. The final version of the appropriations bill provides $110 million above the request for humanitarian assistance in Haiti, totaling $460 million. It also includes funding for various services and benefits for Haitian evacuees and migrants. The enacted version approves $10.6 million for USCIS costs associated with Haitian migrants, $4.4 million below the request due to lower application requests. The total request for Recovery and Reconstruction funding in this supplemental proposal was $1.1 billion, primarily for new activities. The 111th Congress expressed bipartisan support for providing substantial assistance to Haiti in response to the earthquake crisis. Strategies must aim to create a more sustainable Haiti and increase Haitian capacity to utilize foreign aid effectively. The U.S. programs in the supplemental focus on urgent infrastructure repairs, critical health care, governance, and security in Haiti. Some observers are concerned that assistance neglects areas like improving the educational system. The revised Haitian development strategy aims to catalyze economic growth and provide services outside of Port-au-Prince to correct urban-rural imbalances. The supplemental funds address short- and long-term needs for recovery and reconstruction. The supplemental funds in Haiti address short- and long-term needs for recovery and reconstruction, focusing on decentralization to develop new growth poles outside of Port-au-Prince. Scientists are assisting in selecting less vulnerable areas for development, but officials warn of the high cost of developing long-neglected areas. Experts emphasize the need for targeted poverty reduction programs and building the capacity of Haitians to eventually take over projects. The supplemental proposal requested $749 million in Economic Support Funds for International Assistance programs in Haiti, focusing on rebuilding infrastructure, providing technical assistance, and working on reconstruction projects for essential services like shelter, water, sanitation, healthcare, and electricity. Experts emphasize the need for capacity building of Haitians to eventually take over projects, despite the tension between effectiveness, efficiency, and the time and money required for training. The Administration requested up to $120 million of Economic Support Funds (ESF) to be transferred to a multi-donor trust fund for Haiti, to leverage resources from other donors. ESF monies could also be transferred to USAID for staffing needs. Some experts suggest developing small-scale clean energy sources locally in Haiti. Members express concern about insufficient funding for children's needs and psychological support. The Haiti supplemental request includes $144 million for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement activities to enhance security in Haiti. This funding would strengthen law enforcement by purchasing equipment, adding police advisors for MINUSTAH, and rebuilding prisons destroyed by the earthquake. Other programs would support the criminal justice sector and counter-narcotics operations. The supplemental request for Haiti includes funding to enhance security, support the criminal justice sector, counter-narcotics operations, and combat human trafficking. It also aims to improve accountability, oversight, and reduce corruption in relief and reconstruction efforts. Additional funding is requested for the Office of the Inspector General of USAID and Treasury Department attach\u00e9 to work with Haitian officials and donors. Advisors will assist in restoring basic treasury processes, reducing corruption, and enhancing economic management skills. The earthquake setback financial management progress, requiring up to $120 million in Economic Support Funds. The Administration requested up to $120 million in Economic Support Funds to contribute to a Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Haiti, aiming to improve coordination and tracking of foreign assistance. Haitian President Rene Preval and Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive acknowledged limited capacities post-earthquake. The Administration also proposed $252 million in U.S. contributions to cancel Haiti's debts to international organizations and reallocating $40 million from the Treasury Department's Debt Restructuring Account for debt relief. The final version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 approves $1.140 billion for all FY2010 recovery and reconstruction activities for Haiti, with additional funding for multilateral debt relief. Direct budget support to the Haitian government requires clear agreements and mechanisms to prevent fund misuse, with funding suspension if conditions are not met. Restrictions and reporting requirements are imposed on recovery and reconstruction funding categories. The final version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 approves $770 million for Economic Support Funds (ESF) for Haiti, with restrictions on disbursement until the Haitian government meets certain conditions, including carrying out reforms and addressing corruption. Additionally, funding for \"justice programs\" is prohibited until an investigation into alleged extrajudicial killings is conducted. The Haitian judiciary system's ability to carry out such investigations and prosecutions is noted to be weak. The final version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 approves $770 million for Economic Support Funds (ESF) for Haiti, with restrictions on disbursement until the Haitian government meets certain conditions. It includes funding for children's education, renewable energy programs, and other development initiatives. Additionally, $148 million is approved for INCLE funding, with allocations for correction facilities, combating human trafficking, and oversight by USAID's Office of the Inspector General. The enacted version of P.L. 111-212 approves increased funding for anti-human trafficking programs in Haiti, including $3 million for oversight by USAID's Office of the Inspector General. It also authorizes a $120 million contribution for a multi-donor trust fund and up to $252 million for multilateral debt relief. The Secretary of State is required to submit progress reports on U.S. contributions towards Haitian development goals. Additionally, $155 million is requested for diplomatic and broadcasting operations in Haiti. The Administration requested $155 million for diplomatic and broadcasting operations in Haiti, with $149.5 million for the State Department and $5 million for the Broadcasting Board of Governors' Creole Language Service. The funds would support logistical assistance, repair of staff housing, and increased broadcasts after the earthquake. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes additional funding for State Department operations and broadcasting in diplomatic operations in Haiti, as well as foreign economic and humanitarian assistance programs for various countries. This includes $147 million for Haiti, $5 million for Mexico, and $175 million for International Narcotics and Law. In addition to funding for Haiti and Mexico, the enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $5 million for emergency security support for U.S. diplomats, $175 million for judicial reform and anti-corruption in the Merida Initiative, $100 million for economic issues in Jordan, $50 million for urgent security needs in Jordan, $25 million for El Salvador for Hurricane Ida relief, $15 million for the Democratic Republic of Congo for civilian assistance, $45 million for pandemic influenza, and $165 million for refugee assistance in various countries. Vietnam is recommended to receive $12 million in funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $12 million in ESF funds for Vietnam to remediate dioxin contamination at Da Nang Airport. The Administration requested $600 million for border security due to security concerns. Additional funding for Capitol Police was also requested. However, no additional funding was requested for preventing teacher, law enforcement, and firefighter layoffs, providing financing for farmers, energy loans, Pell Grants, or mine safety. The House's amended bill did not include the requested funds for preventing layoffs or providing additional Pell Grants. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include funds to prevent teacher, law enforcement, and firefighter layoffs or provide additional Pell Grants. However, the Senate passed an amendment to H.R. 1586, which includes $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund and an increase in federal Medicaid reimbursements to free up funds for states to retain law enforcement and firefighters. President Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan emphasized the need for federal funds to prevent teacher layoffs, but no budget request was made in FY2010. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include funds to prevent teacher layoffs. President Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan emphasized the need for federal funds, but no budget request was made. The House initially included $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund, but withdrew support and adopted the Senate version. Proposed offsets triggered a veto threat from the Administration. The American Association of School Administrators estimates that 275,000 teachers and school staff could be laid off in the 2010-2011 school year without additional funding. The proposed Education Jobs Fund would distribute funds to state governors to prevent teacher layoffs. The HAC majority draft bill would require the U.S. Department of Education to distribute funds to states within 45 days. The HAC majority draft bill would distribute funds to states within 45 days to prevent teacher layoffs. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include supplemental funding for the COPS hiring program. While the H.R. 4899 bill did not include funds for firefighter hiring and retention, the COPS hiring program helped law enforcement agencies facing budget shortfalls by providing temporary solutions. However, if tax revenues do not rebound, states may need to lay off officers again. The proposed $1.179 billion may not be sufficient to meet the demand for hiring funds, as seen with over 7,200 applications requesting $8.3 billion for 40,000 positions in response to previous funding. Funding for the SAFER program was not included in the bill, despite earlier proposals for $500 million to support firefighter hiring and retention. Funding for the SAFER program was $210 million in FY2009, $420 million in FY2010, and $305 million requested in FY2011. Proponents argue for an additional $500 million due to budget shortfalls at the state and local level threatening firefighter staffing levels. Opponents believe the current funding is sufficient, considering the need to reduce federal spending. P.L. 111-212 did not include most of the proposed funding for various programs, including the Department of Agriculture receiving $32 million for credit shortages in farm and rural housing loan programs. The supplemental funds address shortages in the farm loan and rural housing loan guarantee programs due to high demand since 2008. Banks reducing credit availability depleted regular appropriations by May 2010. Without additional funds, qualified loan applications may go unfunded for the rest of FY2010. The enacted version offsets $50 million by limiting outlays from a bioenergy program. For rural housing loans, fees for loan guarantees are raised, and $697 million in loan guarantee authority is added. The Agriculture Department is requesting $75 million for direct loans in FY2011. The Agriculture Department is requesting $75 million for direct loans under Section 502 and a new fee structure for loan guarantees. The enacted version provides $32 million to support farm loans and guarantees, in addition to $5.1 billion already available for FY2010. For FY2011, $151 million is requested to support farm loans. The final version dropped $50 million for The Emergency Food Assistance Program and included other rescissions from Agriculture Department accounts. The FY2010 supplemental funding included $70 million from unobligated balances from the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The Administration's FY2011 request for the Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program is pending, with hopes to accelerate clean energy projects. The House version included $180 million for innovative energy technology projects, supporting nuclear power facilities and renewable energy projects. DOE estimates that this appropriation could support up to $18 billion in loan guarantee authority. The DOE requested $36.0 billion in loan guarantee authority for nuclear power projects and $500 million for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in FY 2011. Established in 2005, the Loan Guarantee Program supports innovative energy technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act in FY 2009 provided $6 billion for renewable energy projects. $2 billion was re-programmed for the Cash-for-Clunkers program in July 2009. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 does not include $4.95 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program. The House Appropriations Committee FY2011 subcommittee allocations include an additional $5.7 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program, while the Senate Appropriations Committee did not include the extra funding. The Federal Pell Grant program, authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, provides need-based grant aid to approximately 8.3 million undergraduate students in FY2010. The Federal Pell Grant Program provides need-based grant aid to around 8.3 million undergraduate students in FY2010, funded through discretionary and mandatory appropriations. The Administration requested an additional $600 million for border security, with $399 million for DHS and $201 million for DOJ, including funds for new Border Patrol agents, unmanned aerial detection systems, and ICE agents. The FY2010 Supplemental included funding for border security, with $201 million allocated to DOJ for new law enforcement presence along the Southwest border. This funding would support ATF Gunrunner Teams, FBI Hybrid Task Forces, DEA agents, equipment, operational support, attorneys, and immigration judges. Additionally, funding would be provided to support Mexican law enforcement operations with ballistic and DNA analysis, information sharing, technical capabilities, and assistance. The House passed H.R. 5875 with $701 million for border security on July 28, 2010, which is $100 million more than the Administration's request. The funding includes $201 million to DOJ for border security efforts, primarily for more law enforcement personnel. Additionally, the Administration requested $118 million in discretionary supplemental appropriations for activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Administration requested funding for various response activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, including programs for employment assistance, inspections, enforcement, economic impact mitigation, and enforcement actions. The final version of H.R. 4899 approves $94 million for oil-spill related programs, including funding for enforcement actions, research, economic assistance, impact studies, and seafood inspection technologies. The request for a new employment assistance program was not approved, but $26 million was added for NOAA to provide fisheries disaster relief and stock assessment in the Gulf. The final version of H.R. 4899 approves $94 million for oil-spill related programs, including funding for enforcement actions, research, economic assistance, impact studies, and seafood inspection technologies. Additionally, $26 million was allocated for NOAA to provide fisheries disaster relief, expanded stock assessment of fisheries in the Gulf, and a study of the long-term effects on the ecosystem in the Gulf. The government allocated funds for various purposes, including settling cases related to Agent Orange exposure, Indian land trusts, discrimination claims of black farmers, and funding for Coast Guard response activities. The Secretary of the VA has authority to determine service-connected health problems for veterans. The additional funding for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was proposed as emergency funding. The Administration proposed additional mandatory funding for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill as emergency funding exempt from PAYGO rules. Court settlements require new legislative authority and funds, subject to budget rules like PAYGO. The Secretary of the VA has authority to establish presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure, including Parkinson's disease and ischemic heart disease. Proposed regulations issued on March 25, 2010, estimate $13.4 billion in costs for new presumptions of service connection for Agent Orange-related conditions in FY2010. Approximately 86,000 veterans may receive retroactive benefits. The VA Secretary has the authority to compensate veterans once regulations are issued, with CBO estimating $5 billion needed in FY2010 instead of $13.4 billion. The CBO estimated that $5 billion, instead of $13.4 billion, would be needed in FY2010 for new veterans benefits related to Agent Orange. The differences in estimates are due to uncertainty about when final regulations will be issued and the time needed to process disability claims. H.R. 4899 includes the $13.4 billion requested by the Administration, with a provision delaying payment until after Congressional review. This will not impact the amount of veterans' disability compensation as claims will be back-dated to the date of eligibility. The Administration requested $4.6 billion to settle two longstanding cases against the government: $1.15 billion for the Pigford Black Farmers Discrimination Case; and $3.4 billion for the Cobell Indian Trust Litigation Settlement. Claimants argue that settlements could be voided if funds are not appropriated by certain dates, but deadlines have been extended. The FY2010 budget supplemental requested $1.15 billion for the Pigford II discrimination case. The Pigford II settlement requested $1.15 billion in FY2010 but funds were not appropriated by the deadline. Plaintiffs have the right to void the settlement if funds are not allocated, but it is unlikely to happen soon. The Cobell v. Salazar case settlement requested $3.4 billion, with $1.4 billion for plaintiffs and $2 billion for trust land interests and education scholarships. The settlement was agreed upon by plaintiffs and the Interior, Treasury, and Justice departments in December 2009. The Cobell lawsuit settlement, agreed upon in December 2009, requires legislative authorization by August 6, 2010, with a deadline recently extended. The lawsuit arose from Interior's inability to accurately account for Individual Indian Monies trust accounts, leading to a total asset value over $460 million. Both plaintiffs and defendants may support the settlement to end years of costly litigation. Some Indian organizations and plaintiffs oppose congressional approval of the settlement. The Cobell settlement, involving contentious litigation and costing millions, faces opposition and support. H.R. 4899 does not include the requested $4.6 billion for settlements. Direct spending authority from the Judgment Fund was proposed in earlier versions but dropped in the final bill. Senator Reid may propose passing these provisions separately. Senator Reid's office may propose passing provisions for court settlements separately in a new bill or by attaching them to other legislation. Funding for court settlements in other bills would require offsets or savings in mandatory programs under PAYGO provisions. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include $4.68 billion in mandatory savings over ten years from provisions aimed at reducing government medical care expenditures. These provisions involved increasing rebates states receive from drug manufacturers and giving the FTC more authority to limit deals between brand name and generic drug makers. The House version of H.R. 4899 proposed amending Medicaid law to include different forms of outpatient drugs in determining AMP, a benchmark price for Medicaid drug rebates. This change would increase the amount drug manufacturers owe in rebates to Medicaid. The House proposed amending Medicaid law to include various forms of outpatient drugs in calculating AMP for Medicaid drug rebates, which would increase manufacturers' rebate payments. The Senate did not accept this provision, and a similar amendment was included in a substitute bill. Additionally, the House version of H.R. 4899 includes sections aimed at preventing pay-to-delay arrangements in the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry uses pay-to-delay arrangements, where a patent holder pays a generic manufacturer to delay the entry of a generic drug into the market. This practice increases costs for consumers by delaying the availability of cheaper generic versions of drugs. The pharmaceutical industry uses pay-to-delay arrangements, where a patent holder pays a generic manufacturer to delay the entry of a generic drug into the market. Delays in generic drug availability increase costs for consumers and the government. Proposed provisions aim to make such agreements unlawful, potentially reducing federal budget deficits by $2.68 billion over 2010-2020. The Senate did not accept these provisions in the final bill sent to the President. The enacted version of the bill did not include $538 million for waste, fraud, and abuse initiatives in federal programs. These funds were intended for various government agencies to prevent improper payments and illegal activities. The allocation included $245 million for enhanced tax enforcement by the IRS and $250 million for health care fraud control at HHS. The bill allocated $250 million for HHS Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account. Half of the funds would be used by CMS for WFA activities, $65 million for HHS OIG, $60 million for DOJ, $38 million for SSA, and $5 million for DOL. The funds were not emergency funding and would be available until September 2011 for DOL, SSA, and IRS, and until September 30, 2012 for HHS. CBO estimated a $538 million increase in the federal deficit in 2010. The HHS funds would be available until September 30, 2012. CBO estimated that the additional PI funding would increase the federal deficit by $538 million in 2010. The Administration proposed expanding the Coast Guard's access to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and creating a new unemployment assistance program. The trust fund allows the Coast Guard to withdraw up to $150 million per year for response activities, supported by an excise tax on petroleum. The Administration also suggested a 1 cent increase in the oil barrel tax to replenish the fund and a new unemployment benefit program for those affected by the spill. These proposals are outside the Appropriations Committees' responsibility. The Administration proposed expanding the Coast Guard's access to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and creating a new unemployment assistance program. The trust fund allows withdrawals for response activities, supported by an excise tax on petroleum. The new unemployment benefit program would be funded by the responsible parties under the Oil Pollution Act. CBO estimated $125 million in mandatory appropriations, with $25 million to be recovered from the responsible parties. The Coast Guard would be authorized to make advances from the trust fund to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Administration's proposal would increase the cap on advances from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to $1.5 billion for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Coast Guard would be able to draw up to $100 million each fiscal year, with a total expenditure cap of $1 billion in current law. The proposed increase in the limitation on annual advances would only apply to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to enhance federal emergency response capabilities. The final version of H.R. 4899 included provisions for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund that were the same as those in legislation, P.L. 111-191 (S. 3473) that Congress passed separately on June 15, 2010, in response to concerns raised by Admiral Thad Allen, National Incident Commander for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano. CBO estimated that this legislation would require $50 million in FY2010 offset by $50 million in reimbursements in FY2012, thus not violating PAYGO rules. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include the Administration's proposed new mandatory unemployment compensation program. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010 multiple times between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010, with various actions taken including passing H.R. 4899 with spending for the Disaster Relief Fund and the Department of Labor's summer jobs program. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 with $59.3 billion in spending for various purposes including disaster relief, war funding, and Haiti relief. The House adopted the Senate version and added funds for education, Pell Grants, and summer youth employment, bringing the total spending to $81.8 billion. The Senate failed to pass the amended version, leading to disagreements between the two chambers. Ultimately, the House withdrew its support for the amended version and adopted the original Senate version. The House receded from the July 1, 2010 version of H.R. 4899 and adopted the Senate May 25 version by a vote of 308-114 on July 27, 2010. The bill, totaling $5.7 billion, focused on disaster relief and did not include war-related or Haiti relief funding. The Senate version included funding for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, war-related activities, Haiti relief, and court settlements. The Senate version of H.R. 4899 included $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, $36.6 billion for DOD's and State Department/USAID war-related activities, $2.9 billion for Haiti relief and reconstruction, $200 million for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill response, and $13.4 billion for additional benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. The total spending was $59.3 billion, offset by $300 million in rescissions, resulting in a total of $58.9 billion. The Senate version was $4.1 billion below the Administration's request and included additional funding for U.S. disaster relief programs and foreign aid. The Senate debated H.R. 4899 from May 25-May 27, 2010, focusing on amendments for border security, Gulf oil spill response, supplemental spending, national disasters funding, and Afghanistan withdrawal. Majority Leader Senator Reid proposed considering and voting on six amendments with strict time limits, followed by a cloture motion vote. The Senate rejected the six amendments, including proposals for additional National Guard funding for border security and measures to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Landrieu and Cochran proposed measures to respond to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, including relief for small businesses. Senator Menendez proposed an amendment for oil polluters to pay full spill costs. Senators McCain and Coburn suggested cutting $59 billion in federal funding to offset deficit spending. Senator Inouye questioned the feasibility of proposals to rescind balances and cap federal salaries. Six amendments were rejected, including McCain's for National Guard funding and Kyl's for border security funding. Several budget-related amendments were proposed, including Kyl's $200 million for border security, Cornyn's National Guard deployment funds, Feingold's troop redeployment timetable, and Coburn's $59 billion in cuts to offset costs. Amendments were withdrawn or rejected due to budget constraints and lack of votes. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 with amendments including budget cuts and additional funding for domestic programs. The House later passed an amended version with more funding and rescissions. On May 25, 2010, the House adopted a rule governing the consideration of H.R. 4899, which included funding for settlement costs, a summer jobs program, and changes to transportation grant formulas and tax rules. The House also passed additional funding for domestic programs through an amendment. On July 1, 2010, the House passed House Amendment No. 2 by 239 to 182, which included additional funding for domestic programs not in the Senate bill. Republican members argued for confining spending to FEMA disaster assistance, war funding, new VA benefits, and settling court cases, while Democrats justified additional domestic spending to prevent layoffs and provide credit for farmers, energy projects, and students. Debate also focused on war-related amendments and the Administration's policy in Afghanistan. The House passed additional funding on July 1, 2010, including $10.0 billion for Education Job Funds, $5.0 billion for Pell Grants, and funds for border security, Medicare, and alternative energy. The House also allocated money for oil spill recovery, agricultural loans, and mine safety efforts. Additionally, $2.5 billion was designated for non-defense DOD spending, with extra funds for fuel costs and base closure improvements. The House version added $300 million for base closure transportation improvements and $16.5 million for a Soldier Readiness Center at Fort Hood. It included $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in savings from mandatory programs. Rescissions of unobligated authority can offset new spending, and unused budget authority expires, reducing the deficit. The House version of H.R. 4899 included $12.2 billion in rescissions, with funds from various departments like DOD, Education, and State Department. The President threatened to veto any bill that undermined his authority in Afghanistan or cut $800 million from education initiatives. Unused budget authority can offset new spending and reduce the deficit. The House considered and rejected three amendments related to war funding in Afghanistan on July 1, 2010. The first two amendments failed by wide margins, while the third required the President to submit a withdrawal plan by April 4, 2011. The House rejected an amendment that required the President to submit a withdrawal plan for Afghanistan by April 4, 2011. The amendment also called for a new national intelligence estimate for Afghanistan and Pakistan, and recommendations to increase oversight of contractors in Afghanistan. The proposal failed by a vote of 162 to 260. Additionally, the House leadership removed funding proposals for the COPS program and Firefighter Assistance grants before floor action."
