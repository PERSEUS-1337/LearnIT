    "content": "The \"Great Lakes Nutrient Removal Assistance Act\" aims to address water pollution in the Great Lakes System by focusing on nutrient pollution, particularly phosphorus loading. The Act emphasizes the importance of limiting phosphorus loads to control algal growth and highlights nutrient removal technology as an effective method for reducing harmful nutrients from point sources. Section 118 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to establish a Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program for Great Lakes States and municipalities to install technologies reducing total nutrients in wastewater discharge. Priority is given to facilities where nutrient removal technologies would have the greatest impact. The Nutrient Removal Technology Grant Program aims to install technologies in Great Lakes States and municipalities to reduce nutrient discharge, prioritizing areas where the greatest environmental benefits can be achieved. Applicants can submit grant applications to the Administrator for approval. If approved, grants may be awarded to support the implementation of nutrient removal technologies. The Administrator may grant up to 55% of the cost for installing nutrient removal technologies at eligible municipal wastewater treatment facilities with a design capacity of at least 500,000 gallons per day. The term 'Great Lakes Water Quality Protocol of 2012' refers to the agreement signed in Washington on September 7, 2012. The subsection authorizes $100,000,000 annually for wastewater treatment facilities in the Great Lakes System with a capacity of at least 500,000 gallons per day. Administrative costs are capped at 4% of the total amount."
