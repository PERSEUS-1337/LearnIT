    "content": "In FY2014, the Department of Defense (DOD) obligated over $280 billion for federal contracts, surpassing all other federal agencies combined. DOD's spending accounted for 8% of federal spending. Analysts and officials believe that utilizing data for acquisition decisions could lead to significant cost savings, resource allocation improvements, and enhanced military operations effectiveness. The National Defense Industrial Association emphasized the importance of data as a critical step towards enhancing defense acquisitions. Congress has taken steps to improve DOD's efficiency, including mandating auditability, incorporating acquisition reform in legislation, and conducting hearings on agency operations and reform. Improved data analysis could potentially lead to more effective decision-making, prompting Congress to consider increasing oversight and enabling DOD to conduct better operations. The report examines the extent to which DOD effectively uses data for decision-making, critical elements needed for better data utilization, recent efforts to improve data use, and potential questions for Congress. It focuses on defense acquisitions as a case study. Data analysis is seen as crucial for informed policy decisions and program management. Many analysts believe data analysis is crucial for making well-informed policy decisions and managing government programs. Access to sufficient data allows decisionmakers to measure program effectiveness, inform policy decisions, and provide transparency. A lack of data can lead to incorrect conclusions and wasteful policies. Reports have highlighted instances where officials lacked access to data and analytical tools, leading to inefficiencies and excess inventories in government programs. The DOD's lack of proper data review and tracking of spare parts led to excess inventories exceeding $1 billion. Reports from the Inspector General and GAO highlighted unreliable data affecting audit readiness and supply chain management in Afghanistan. Despite the importance of data, DOD does not sufficiently incorporate it into decision-making, leading to policies based on assumptions rather than substantive data. Decisions in various programs, from Afghanistan operations to future weapon systems, are often made without substantive data, relying on assumptions instead. Retired Air Force General Norman Schwartz emphasized the importance of data-driven decisions, especially in the private sector. Congress has recognized the significance of data in government operations, enacting the DATA Act in 2014 to improve transparency and accountability in federal spending. The Department of Defense lacks accurate data on spending and personnel, hindering effective management and national security. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates highlighted the difficulty in obtaining reliable information, leading to inefficiency and wasted resources. This data shortfall also hampers the ability to measure the results of national security policies. The Department of Defense faces challenges in gathering accurate data for effective management and national security. Lack of reliable information hinders decision-making and assessment of priorities for military actions. Key elements needed for DOD to utilize data effectively include information systems, comprehensive and accurate data, and data-informed decision-making. In some cases, decision-makers lack even basic databases, leading to manual, time-consuming processes for managing multibillion-dollar programs. The Department of Defense struggles with managing data effectively, with manual processes hindering efficiency and introducing errors. Flawed financial management systems have impeded budgetary accounting improvements, with efforts to enhance systems expected to continue until 2017. Having a single, reliable source for analyzing data sets is crucial, as multiple information technology systems can create conflicting data sources. The Department of Defense faces challenges in managing data effectively, with multiple IT systems containing conflicting information. Calls have been made to improve data system architecture for better collection, management, and analysis of acquisition data. Existing systems lack reliable or complete information, leading to issues with data reliability and sufficiency. The Federal Procurement Data System and Operations and Support costs highlight the challenges in improving data quality. The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) is a crucial database for U.S. government-wide procurement, relied upon by Congress, executive branch agencies, analysts, and the public. However, concerns have been raised about the accuracy and reliability of the data in FPDS, prompting efforts to improve its quality. Analysts often use FPDS to identify broad trends despite its limitations in utility, accuracy, and completeness. The General Services Administration (GSA) is working on overhauling data systems, including FPDS, to improve reliability and usefulness. Efforts include gathering feedback from stakeholders to enhance data quality. GAO found inconsistencies in DOD reports on weapon system O&S costs in 2012, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and reliable data for effective oversight. The GAO found that DOD officials lacked comprehensive and reliable data to analyze operations and support cost growth for major systems. O&S data were incomplete and inconsistently reported, hindering effective oversight. The Under Secretary of Defense for AT&L is now requiring more consistent use of units for calculating O&S costs, but building a bank of data for analysis will take years. Other phases of the acquisition process also face data access, quality, and availability issues. Other phases of the acquisition process also encounter data access, quality, and availability challenges. Reliable data may not reach decision-makers, leading to decisions based on perceptions or anecdotal evidence. Institutional and cultural barriers hinder data sharing within the DoD, with a conservative bias towards labeling and reluctance to share information. The challenges in data access within the DoD are exacerbated by conservative bias and reluctance to share information. Decisionmakers struggle to use existing data effectively, with a lack of personnel capable of complex data analysis. Some leaders do not understand how to utilize data for informed decisions, leading to unchecked statistics influencing decisions. It is crucial to recognize the limitations of data in pursuing a data-driven approach to decision-making. In pursuing a data-driven approach to decision-making, it is crucial to understand the limitations of data. Some caution against collecting data for data's sake and emphasize the importance of knowing what data is needed and why. It is also important to ensure that the benefits of data analysis outweigh the costs of collecting and analyzing data. Time and resources spent on data collection should be justified by the value it adds to decision-making processes. $100 million dollars to build an IT system for decision-making on a $75 million project may not be a wise investment. Striving for perfect data can hinder effective analysis, as data don't need to be perfect to be useful. Focus should be on having sufficient data for reasonable conclusions. Critical questions include what analysis can be done now, how to model correctly, and understanding the uncertainty of the data. Imperfect data can still be useful, and even perfect data may not lead to perfect analysis. Cost estimates, especially for large programs, are inherently imprecise but can still aid in understanding. Cost estimating is crucial for understanding risks and making informed decisions. Despite spending over $80 billion on contracts in Afghanistan from FY2007 to FY2013, the lack of reliable data hindered strategic contracting decisions. The absence of IT systems and databases to track spending in Afghanistan left DOD without necessary data for effective management. The lack of reliable data hindered strategic contracting decisions in Afghanistan. The absence of IT systems and databases left DOD without necessary data for effective management, hindering the distribution of supplies and equipment to the warfighter. Multiple conflicting information systems and lack of interoperability resulted in wasteful spending and poor data sharing between agencies. Data reliability remained questionable as information was often kept at the local level and did not flow up to the central database. The reliability of data in Afghanistan was questionable due to incomplete and inaccurate tracking. Only about 10% of all data records were eventually put into the central database, with an estimated error rate of approximately 50%. Data on reconstruction projects often lacked required elements, leading to poor data sharing and hindering strategic contracting decisions. Officials in Afghanistan faced challenges due to incomplete and inaccurate data tracking, with an estimated error rate of 50%. Many personnel were unaware of existing data sources, such as the Central Command quarterly contractor census and FPDS, which contained crucial contracting information. Despite data shortcomings, the Department of Defense has made progress in identifying necessary data for better contract decisions and improving data reliability. Leveraging data systems from Afghanistan operations could benefit future operations. The Department of Defense is working on improving data systems for future operations, aiming to provide timely access to critical information for decision-making. There are significant gaps in available data and its reliability, with efforts underway to gather and analyze data for policy decisions. Analysts emphasize the importance of integrating data usage into the organization's culture and routines, with leadership support being crucial for this cultural shift. Leadership support is crucial for successful analytics programs in agencies. Senior acquisition officials in DOD are emphasizing the need for data-informed decision-making processes. Annual reports analyzing defense acquisitions have been released, showcasing a data-driven approach. Senior leadership is promoting a more data-driven process for supply chain management, but some argue that more action is needed beyond statements. DOD is investing billions in building IT systems and tools for data-based decision-making. Efforts are underway to improve data quality, overhaul data systems like FPDS, and enhance operations data consistency. An analytics center was established in 2013 to measure acquisitions' effectiveness and craft policy using data. CAPE launched the CADE project to consolidate historical acquisition data into an online platform. CAPE recently launched the CADE project to consolidate historical acquisition data into an online system for decision-makers and cost analysts. The military services are also integrating data into decision-making processes, with the Air Force identifying over $500 million in potential cost savings through the Air Force IT Business Analytics Office. Congress has been credited with helping DOD focus on and improve data analysis. The Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act focused on using data to inform decisions in the early stages of the acquisition process, leading to improved cost estimates and requiring DOD to conduct root cause analysis of major defense acquisition programs with cost growth. The FY2010 NDAA mandated DOD to ensure financial statements are audit-ready and improve management accuracy and reliability. DOD is working towards becoming audit-ready to improve efficiency and resource deployment. Past efforts to improve data-based decision-making have had mixed results, with some successes like the Navy's Air System Command and failures like the Air Force's cancelled ERP system. Implementing and improving data systems will take time, requiring a cultural shift towards using data for decisions. The senior DOD official emphasized the need to build a robust historical database to understand the performance of the acquisition system. Congressional support is crucial for promoting the use of data in decision-making within DOD. Congressional action could allocate resources and pass legislation to influence decision-making processes. Congress could influence DOD decision-making by allocating resources and passing legislation. To improve defense acquisitions, Congress should consider investing in IT systems and enhancing analytical capabilities within DOD offices. Key questions to address include DOD's strategy for data needs, technology deployment, and in-house analytical capability. To effectively use data in decision-making, DOD needs a culture that values data-driven decisions and integrates data analysis into standard routines. Congress could consider legislation to promote data use and should examine DOD's culture, incentives, and strategies for incorporating data analysis into routine processes. The recent RAND report highlighted inefficiencies in access to acquisition data within DOD, raising questions about the balance between data-sharing for efficiency and information security concerns."
