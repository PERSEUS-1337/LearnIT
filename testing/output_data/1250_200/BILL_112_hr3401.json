    "content": "The \"Enhanced Border Security Act\" aims to protect US citizens from external threats by implementing counterinsurgency tactics to combat terrorist activities in Mexico. This includes securing the US-Mexico border, disrupting criminal organizations' financing in US cities, and assisting the Mexican government in reducing violence, corruption, and improving cooperation between military and law enforcement. Mexican drug cartels have evolved into transnational criminal organizations, engaging in various illicit activities such as human smuggling, stolen oil trafficking, weapons smuggling, extortion, kidnapping, and cybercrime. They have increased profits and pose a threat to regional security, with estimates of stolen oil proceeds reaching $2-4 billion annually and $6.6 billion generated from human smuggling to the US. Transnational criminal organizations have expanded and matured, directly impacting the security of citizens and governments in the region, including the US. The Merida Initiative, led by the Department of State, has failed to address the evolution of Mexican drug cartels into transnational criminal organizations, their diversification into illicit activities, and the use of insurgency tactics that undermine the Mexican state. The initiative has faced implementation challenges and programmatic delays. The Merida Initiative aims to control the political space in Mexico and address challenges and delays in implementation. Counterinsurgency tactics will isolate criminal organizations from their power sources while addressing military and non-military conditions. The strategy aims to protect US citizens by empowering a competent government that operates within international laws and regulations. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"terrorist insurgency\" as the use of irregular warfare by criminal organizations to influence public opinion and undermine government control. It also defines \"transnational criminal organization\" as a group operating internationally for illegal gain, protected by corruption or violence. SEC. 5. COUNTERINSURGENCY STRATEGY AND CONDITIONALITY. The Secretary of State, along with other key officials, must submit a counterinsurgency strategy to Congress within 90 days. The strategy should define transnational criminal organizations in Mexico, assess their capabilities and areas of influence, and evaluate Mexico's law enforcement and military forces to counter the threat posed by these organizations. The strategy must describe the operations of transnational criminal organizations within the United States and at international borders, using this information to coordinate with relevant agencies to combat these organizations and isolate them from their power sources. The strategy to combat terrorist insurgency in Mexico includes a plan to target the operations, financial networks, and money laundering techniques of transnational criminal organizations. This involves increasing the number of drug traffickers on the Specially Designated Nationals list and providing progress reports on designating individuals and entities supporting these organizations. The strategy to combat terrorist insurgency in Mexico includes targeting the financial networks of transnational criminal organizations, increasing cooperation between law enforcement agencies, and developing accounting procedures for grant assistance. At the United States-Mexico border, a plan is in place to enhance resources, technology, and infrastructure for border security in coordination with Mexico and the Department of Homeland Security. The Government of the United States aims to create a secure border area by doubling the number of Border Patrol agents, developing additional infrastructure, and implementing technology to support Border Patrol activities. The plan includes implementing technology such as cameras, radars, sensors, and unmanned aerial vehicles to support Border Patrol activities. Additionally, there will be a standardized policy for prosecuting border-related offenses, a joint US-Mexico intelligence program, and increased use of Border Patrol Special Response Teams focusing on high-priority threats like weapons, cash smuggling, and drugs along the border. The development of a multi-agency action plan in Mexico includes increasing coordination among military and law enforcement agencies, establishing secure areas around key population centers, and incorporating best practices for combating criminal organizations. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of incorporating lessons learned from US military and law enforcement in training programs worldwide, securing the environment, and diminishing support for transnational criminal organizations through strengthening governance and rule of law. The curr_chunk focuses on promoting lawfulness and incentives for US businesses in Mexico, developing safe communities for families and youth, and enhancing local governance. It also aims to neutralize transnational criminal organizations by re-evaluating threats in Mexican regions. The curr_chunk focuses on neutralizing transnational criminal organizations in Mexican regions by re-evaluating threats, assigning specialized task forces, requesting US military advisors' support, and assisting Mexican federal law enforcement operations. It also includes a report on Mexican and Central American activities. The curr_chunk focuses on providing intelligence to regional task forces and includes a report on Mexican and Central American extradition requests. Updates are required from the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Secretary of State on a quarterly basis. If the Secretary of State fails to submit the required counterinsurgency strategy, 20 percent of funds may be withheld. If the Secretary of State fails to submit the required counterinsurgency strategy, 20 percent of funds for fiscal year 2012 will be withheld until the strategy is submitted. Funds for the Merida Initiative can be used to develop and implement the required counterinsurgency strategy under section 5(a)."
