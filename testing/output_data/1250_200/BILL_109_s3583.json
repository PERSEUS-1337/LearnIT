The Secretary will establish a system for registration and renewal of payroll tax deposit agents, with fees not exceeding $100. Agents can choose to submit a bond or undergo an annual audit. Disclosures and direct notification requirements will also be mandated. The new regulations require registration and renewal of payroll tax deposit agents, with penalties for noncompliance up to $10,000 every 90 days. A payroll tax deposit agent is defined as a person providing payroll processing or tax services to employers with authority to access funds for tax deposits. This excludes those only transferring funds without impounding them for this purpose. The regulations require payroll tax deposit agents to submit a bond of $50,000 to $500,000 and undergo annual audits by an independent third party based on specified principles determined by the Secretary. The regulations mandate annual audits by an independent third party for payroll tax deposit agents, ensuring compliance with specific principles set by the Secretary, including maintaining balanced escrow accounts, avoiding commingling of funds, not using escrow funds for operating costs, and providing evidence of paying employment taxes. Agents must also disclose clients' liability for federal and state employment taxes.

The Secretary will prescribe regulations necessary for carrying out the provisions related to confidential tax information and payroll tax deposit agents. Section 6672 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include payroll tax deposit agents, without creating any inference with the previous interpretation of the code.

The amendments related to payroll tax deposit agents will take effect upon the enactment of the Act, with penalties applying to failures after that date."
