    "content": "The \"Keep It in the Ground Act of 2015\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings and a statement of policy. Congress finds that global temperatures have increased by 0.9 degrees Celsius from 1880 to 2014, primarily due to human activities like burning fossil fuels. Greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, leading to a warming trend with significant impacts on the economy and environment. To avoid exceeding a 2-degree Celsius increase, 80 percent of carbon from fossil fuel reserves must be kept in the ground. To prevent exceeding a 2-degree Celsius warming, 80 percent of carbon from proven fossil fuel reserves must be kept in the ground. Ending new leases for fossil fuels on Federal land will prevent the release of 90 percent of potential emissions. Federal land and waters should be managed to avoid dangerous climate impacts and promote a transition to a clean energy economy by keeping fossil fuels in the ground. The Federal Government should not issue any new leases or renew existing ones. To benefit the people of the United States, no new leases or renewals for coal, oil, or natural gas on Federal land or waters will be issued. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\nExtend - extending a lease under the Mineral Leasing Act beyond the existing term.\nNonproducing lease - a lease where no fossil fuel has been extracted for commercial use.\nReinstate - reinstating a lease after a violation that led to suspension or cancellation.\nRenew - renewing a lease for a term not longer than the maximum renewal term.\nSecretary - the Secretary of the Interior.\n\nSEC. 4.
