    "content": "The Bush Administration released The Budget of the U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 2008 on February 5, 2007, containing detailed budget information, policy proposals, and economic forecasts for FY2007 through FY2012. It also addresses long-term fiscal issues and historical budget data. The congressional budget process for FY2008 began with the Administration submitting its budget to Congress. Congress adopted the FY2008 budget resolution in May 2007 and started considering appropriation bills shortly after. By August, the House had passed all twelve regular appropriations bills, while the Senate passed some but not all by the end of FY2007. In October, the Senate passed the defense and Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bills. In October, the Senate passed the defense appropriations and Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bills. The House passed a continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 52) to fund the government until November 16, which the Senate also passed. The President signed the continuing resolution on September 29 (P.L. 110-92). Congress approved the Labor-HHS-Education bill (H.R. 3043, S. 1710) and the Defense bill (H.R. 3222, P.L. 110-116) with $459 billion in non-emergency budget authority. The President vetoed the former but signed the latter. The defense bill included extended funding for government operations until December 14. Congress then passed another funding continuation (H.J.Res. 69) to December 21, which the President signed. On December 19, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) incorporating 10 remaining bills. On December 19, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 2764) that included 10 remaining regular appropriations bills and a fourth continuing resolution (H.J.Res. 72). The President signed a fourth continuing resolution (P.L. 110-149) on the same day, funding government operations through the end of the calendar year. On December 26, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161), providing $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. Budget estimates for FY2008 from CBO, OMB, and Congress can vary due to different assumptions and techniques. The CBO's first budget report for FY2008 included baseline deficit estimates for FY2007 through FY2017, showing a decrease in the deficit from $172 billion in FY2007 to $98 billion in FY2008. The report projected a surplus of $170 billion in FY2012 and $249 billion in FY2017, based on assumptions such as constant discretionary spending, expiration of tax cuts after 2010, and lapsing of the AMT \"patch\". These projections are subject to change as new data and economic conditions emerge. After 2010, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will expire, along with the alternative minimum tax \"patch\". The expiration of these tax cuts and zero growth in discretionary spending explain the declining deficit and emerging surpluses. Future deficits are expected to increase due to the retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare costs. The CBO's report includes estimates on the budgetary effects of policies like making the tax cuts permanent, indexing the AMT for inflation, and freezing discretionary appropriations. The CBO analyzed the President's budget proposals, forecasting higher revenues and smaller outlays, resulting in a smaller deficit than initially projected. By FY2012, the deficit was expected to be $31 billion instead of a $61 billion surplus. The difference in forecasts was attributed to medium-term projection uncertainties. The cumulative deficit estimate for 2008-2012 based on the President's proposals was $790 billion, higher than the President's budget estimate of $514 billion. President Bush's FY2008 budget proposed extending and making permanent tax cuts, reducing estimated receipts by almost $600 billion between FY2008 and FY2012. The budget also included a cost estimate of $637 billion over 10 years for proposed personal accounts for Social Security. Administration estimates suggested reductions in mandatory spending by $96 billion over five years and $309 billion over 10 years. The Administration's budget proposals aim to save $59 billion over five years and increase spending by $359 billion over ten years, mainly due to the introduction of personal Social Security accounts. The budget includes estimates for revenue and mandatory spending changes up to FY2012, with limited information beyond that. President Bush also proposed cutting $22 billion in budget authority for FY2008 by eliminating, reducing, or reforming 141 programs. The Mid-Session Review in July reiterated these proposals. The Administration's Mid-Session Review in FY2008 showed a $19 billion increase in the deficit estimate compared to the February outlook. The rise in the five-year deficit was mainly due to fast growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending, driven by rising healthcare prices and patient volumes. CBO analyzes FY2008 appropriations, estimating new budget authority and outlays for different categories. In FY2008, CBO estimated $932.8 billion in nonemergency discretionary budget authority, matching the President's request. Non-defense discretionary budget authority was slightly higher than defense discretionary budget authority. The McConnell Amendment added $70 billion in emergency funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Senate budget resolution projected a FY2008 deficit of $249 billion. The Senate budget resolution projected a FY2008 deficit of $249 billion, with higher levels of discretionary spending proposed compared to the President's proposal. Both the Senate and House resolutions required offsets to extend expiring tax cuts, with the House resolution expecting a FY2012 surplus of $153 billion. The House and Senate budget resolutions, along with the President's proposal, all aim for a balanced budget in FY2012. They assume minimal military funding post-FY2008 and increased AMT impact on middle-income taxpayers. The President's budget projects little growth in discretionary spending, while the House and Senate resolutions assume otherwise. The House and Senate budget resolutions assume that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will expire unless the cost of extending them is offset through other revenue gains or spending reductions, leading to a large jump in tax revenues after 2010. Budget projections are uncertain and depend on models reflecting assumptions about the economy and policy changes. OMB and CBO have provided measures of the accuracy and statistical unbiasedness of their forecasts in recent years. Budget projections are based on models reflecting assumptions about the economy, tax and program changes, and other factors. Economic conditions, changes in policies, and technical components of budget models can impact estimates. Factors like population demographics are relatively stable, while others like productivity growth and business cycles are harder to predict. Federal revenues can be affected by volatile factors like financial market trends. GDP growth can have a significant impact on budget estimates. Federal revenues are affected by factors like financial market trends and GDP growth. Small changes in economic conditions can lead to significant changes in budget estimates. For example, a 0.1% decrease in real GDP growth could increase the deficit by $61 billion over five years and $273 billion over 10 years. Government policies, such as extending military operations or allowing tax cuts to lapse, also impact budget outlook. Forecast accuracy decreases over time due to potential policy and economic changes. The President's FY2008 budget includes an analysis of previous forecast accuracy. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) analyzed budget estimates and found that future deficit projections are highly uncertain. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) also evaluates forecast accuracy and provides explanations for differences in projections. The Senate Budget Committee (SBC) passed the FY2008 budget resolution after amendments and debates. The accuracy of budget forecasts decreases over time due to economic and policy changes. The Senate and House passed the FY2008 budget resolution in March 2007, with a focus on additional domestic spending and accommodating war funding. Both resolutions included rules for deficit neutrality. Conferees were appointed to resolve differences, leading to an agreement in May 2007 with discretionary spending set at $954 billion. In FY2008, discretionary spending was set at $954 billion, exceeding the President's request. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees worked on drafting appropriations bills, with most approved by mid-July. Congress passed the Labor-HHS-Education and Defense bills, which the President vetoed and signed, respectively. A continuing resolution was passed to fund government operations at the end of FY2007. In FY2008, Congress passed multiple appropriations bills amid policy disagreements and spending levels. A continuing resolution was signed to fund government operations until November 16, followed by the approval of the Labor-HHS-Education and Defense bills. Subsequently, funding was extended through various continuing resolutions and an omnibus appropriations bill incorporating 10 remaining regular appropriations bills. The President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of FY2008 (P.L. 110-161) on December 26, providing $555 billion in discretionary budget authority. The Administration's budget proposed outlays of $2,902 billion for FY2008, rising to $3,246 billion in FY2012. The proposals aimed to increase funding for defense and homeland security, limit non-defense discretionary spending to a 1% annual increase, and slow the growth of some mandatory programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Total mandatory spending would still increase under the proposals. The Administration's budget for FY2008 includes a $30 billion increase for personal accounts in Social Security, raising outlays by $118 billion above the FY2007 estimate. Total outlays would increase by 16.6% between FY2007 and FY2012, with additional funding for security activities, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a slight reduction in mandatory spending. The Administration's budget for FY2008 includes a $118 billion increase in outlays, with reductions in mandatory spending and an increase in net interest payments. The proposals aim to reduce outlays as a percentage of GDP from 20.2% in FY2007 to 20.0% in FY2008, with further decreases projected in the following years. Defense and non-defense discretionary spending are expected to decrease, while mandatory programs like Medicare and Medicaid are projected to grow slightly as percentages of GDP. The Administration's budget for FY2008 includes a $118 billion increase in outlays, with reductions in mandatory spending and an increase in net interest payments. Mandatory programs increase their share of GDP by 0.3%, while net interest falls by 0.2% of GDP. Both Medicare and Medicaid are expected to grow slightly as percentages of GDP. The President's budget would increase defense spending by 6.0% from FY2007 to FY2008, incorporating a $140 billion supplemental for military actions overseas. Non-defense discretionary spending exceeds the current services baseline estimate by $19 billion for FY2008. Over five years, non-defense discretionary outlays grow by an average 0.7% annually, while the Administration's proposed levels fall by an average 0.7% annually. Non-defense discretionary spending falls from $511 billion in FY2007 to $493 billion in FY2012, dropping as a share of GDP from 3.7% in FY2007 to 2.8% in FY2012. The Administration's budget for FY2008 includes a $118 billion increase in outlays, with reductions in mandatory spending and an increase in net interest payments. Mandatory programs increase their share of GDP by 0.3%, while net interest falls by 0.2% of GDP. The budget shows a decrease in non-defense discretionary spending from $511 billion in FY2007 to $493 billion in FY2012, dropping as a share of GDP from 3.7% in FY2007 to 2.8% in FY2012. The President's budget includes proposals to reduce mandatory outlays by $10 billion in FY2008, achieved by slowing the growth of selected mandatory spending activities such as Medicare and Medicaid. Mandatory spending is projected to total $1,100 billion over the same period, growing from $1,465 billion in FY2007 to $1,923 billion in FY2012. The budget for FY2008 includes a $118 billion increase in outlays, with reductions in mandatory spending and an increase in net interest payments. Federal debt has grown rapidly in recent years, and under the Administration's proposals, will continue to grow. Proposed net interest outlays in FY2008 exceed the Administration's current services baseline estimate by $7.8 billion. The Administration's policy proposals would raise FY2012 net interest outlays almost $30 billion above its current services estimate. Net interest payments as a percentage of GDP will show little change throughout the five years, ranging between 1.6% and 1.8% of GDP. CBO's baseline projections for FY2007-FY2017 show outlays rising from 19.9% of GDP in FY2007 to 20.8% of GDP in FY2008, before easing back to 20.0% of GDP in FY2012. Federal outlays as a percentage of GDP fluctuated from 19.9% in FY2007 to 20.8% in FY2008, then decreased to 20.0% in FY2012. The CBO projects FY2017 outlays to be at 20.3% of GDP. Analysts believe that the current-law baseline underestimates future growth in discretionary spending. If discretionary spending grew at the same rate as the economy, federal outlays would increase by $1.55 trillion over the FY2008-FY2017 period. Conversely, keeping discretionary spending at FY2007 levels would result in a $1.65 trillion decrease in federal outlays. Defense spending is expected to rise gradually, reaching $773 billion in FY2017, with defense spending as a percentage of GDP projected to decline over the 10-year period. Defense spending is projected to rise to $773 billion in FY2017, with a gradual decrease in spending as a percentage of GDP over the 10-year period. Alternative scenarios suggest lower spending trajectories if troops are withdrawn from Iraq and Afghanistan. Withdrawal of troops could save about $1.25 trillion by 2017 if all but 30,000 troops are withdrawn by 2010, or $750 billion if all but 75,000 troops are withdrawn by 2013. Non-defense discretionary spending is also expected to increase from $495 billion in FY2007 to $619 billion in FY2017. Non-defense discretionary spending is projected to increase from $495 billion in FY2007 to $619 billion in FY2017. Mandatory spending is expected to rise from $1,457 billion in FY2007 to $2,598 billion in FY2017. Net interest is estimated to grow from $235 billion in FY2007 to $253 billion in FY2008. The CBO's August 2007 baseline estimates show net interest growing from $235 billion in FY2007 to $253 billion in FY2008, with projected surpluses in FY2012 and after reducing federal debt and lowering net interest payments. The Senate Budget Committee's FY2008 budget resolution proposed outlays rising to $3,229 billion in FY2012, including defense funding matching the President's request. The Senate passed the resolution with amendments, aligning closely with the committee's version. The House Budget Committee reported its FY2008 budget resolution, which was passed by the House with no changes. The resolution outlines outlays increasing from $2,933 billion in FY2008 to $3,252 billion in FY2012. The conference agreement included $2,937 billion in FY2008 outlays, with projected outlays rising to $3,255 billion in FY2012. Defense and non-defense spending as a share of GDP are expected to decline, while mandatory spending is projected to increase over the FY2007-FY2012 period. Non-defense spending as a share of GDP is projected to decrease over FY2007-FY2012, while mandatory spending is expected to rise. The President's proposed reductions in mandatory spending would keep it stable relative to GDP, but introducing private Social Security accounts in FY2012 would increase mandatory spending. Various outlooks show different paths for outlays as a percentage of GDP through FY2017. The Administration's proposed outlays decrease after FY2007 due to cuts in discretionary spending. By FY2012, spending would be slightly below its level in FY2000 as a percentage of GDP. The Mid-Session Review shows slightly higher outlays compared to the February budget, mainly due to reestimation. The alternative estimate assumes discretionary appropriations grow with the economy and factors in troop deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. The alternative estimate assumes a decrease in troops deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, leading to higher outlays and increasing the deficit. Outlays as a percentage of GDP are projected to rise to 21.1% in FY2017. Forecasts of federal receipts beyond the short term are uncertain due to economic conditions. The last few fiscal years have seen rapid growth in federal receipts, with increases ranging from 5.5% to 14.5% annually. Receipts rose from 16.3% to 18.4% of GDP from FY2004 to FY2006. OMB and CBO forecasts show varying projections for receipts as a share of GDP, with CBO's baseline reaching 19.8% in FY2012. The President's proposals aim to extend and make permanent expiring tax cuts, leading to a significant increase in receipts over the next five years. In the five-year forecast, receipts are projected to increase by $767 billion, with the President's proposals aiming to make expiring tax cuts permanent. Receipts as a percentage of GDP are expected to fluctuate slightly before rising to 18.6% by FY2012. The Administration estimates that making the tax cuts permanent would reduce cumulative receipts by $374 billion between FY2008 and FY2012 and by $1,617 billion between FY2008 and FY2017. Additionally, proposed relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax is included in the budget for FY2008 but not in subsequent years. The President's proposals aim to increase receipts by $767 billion over five years, with a focus on making expiring tax cuts permanent. Receipts as a percentage of GDP are projected to fluctuate before reaching 18.6% by FY2012. The Administration's estimates show a reduction in cumulative receipts by $374 billion between FY2008 and FY2012 and by $1,617 billion between FY2008 and FY2017 if the tax cuts are made permanent. Relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax is included in the FY2008 budget but not in subsequent years. Individual income taxes have fallen and regained some lost share, remaining about 1% of GDP below their FY2000 level. Corporate income taxes stabilize near 2% of GDP under the Administration's projection. Social Insurance receipts remain stable from FY2006 through FY2012. Excise and other receipts are less than 1% of GDP for all years shown. The FY2008 budget estimated that temporary AMT \"fixes\" would cost $9.1 billion in FY2007 and $47.9 billion in FY2008. CBO estimated that indexing AMT thresholds for inflation would cost about $55 billion a year over the next 10 years. The President's budget aimed to limit the growing reach of the AMT but omitted estimates of the five-year cost of such a fix, leading to an increase in federal receipts by $50 billion to $60 billion a year. Total receipts in the President's budget are expected to remain near their 40-year average of 18.3% of GDP. CBO's baseline revenue estimates, excluding the extension of tax cuts, are larger, rising to over 19.8% of GDP in FY2012 and 20.1% in FY2017. Extending the expiring provisions of tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 would reduce revenues by $418 billion over five years and $1,937 billion over 10 years. Extending tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 would reduce revenues by $418 billion over five years and $1,937 billion over 10 years. Limiting the AMT expansion alone would reduce revenues by $280 billion over five years and $570 billion over 10 years. CBO's estimates of the President's revenue policy proposals were $479 billion smaller than expected. The CBO's estimates of the President's revenue policy proposals were $479 billion smaller than expected over five years. The alternative policy estimates show slower growth in receipts, with receipts falling to approximately 17.5% of GDP by FY2012. The CBO estimates show slower growth in receipts, with revenue falling to approximately 17.5% of GDP by FY2012. The alternative revenue assumptions would result in significant shortfalls compared to baseline projections, requiring offsets to prevent deficits from growing. The level of historical and projected federal receipts as a percentage of GDP is shown in Figure 4. Actual receipts averaged 18.3% of GDP over the period FY1966-FY2006. Projections by CBO and the President's budget submission show estimates fairly close through FY2010, with receipts rising slightly to above 19% of GDP in FY2017 according to CBO's reestimate. The Administration's revenue estimates show little variation over five years, with OMB projecting slightly larger receipts than the February budget. Both sets of estimates assume tax cuts are extended and an adjustment to the AMT expansion occurs only through FY2008. The OMB estimates assume tax cuts are extended and an adjustment to the AMT expansion occurs only through FY2008. Deficits occur when federal spending exceeds receipts, increasing government debt. Surpluses happen when receipts exceed outlays, reducing debt. Running surpluses during strong economic growth is beneficial. The federal government last ran a surplus in FY2001. The FY2007 total deficit was $163 billion, below CBO's estimate and well below the Administration's FY2008 budget. The FY2007 total deficit was $163 billion, slightly below CBO's estimate and well below the Administration's FY2008 budget. The on-budget deficit, excluding Social Security and Postal Service surpluses, was $344 billion. The President's budget proposed a deficit of $239 billion for FY2008 and a small surplus in FY2012. The Administration's baseline estimates showed surpluses appearing in FY2010, two years earlier than the budget reaches a surplus. The FY2007 deficit fell slightly while the FY2008 deficit grew compared to the estimates in the President's budget. The budget is projected to reach a small surplus in FY2012. The budget is projected to reach a small surplus in FY2012, just 0.2% of GDP, slightly smaller than the Administration's original estimate. To achieve deficit reduction goals, strict limits on discretionary spending growth and slower entitlement spending growth are required. The federal deficit is projected to decrease through FY2011 and surpluses are expected from FY2012 to FY2017. Assumptions for baseline projections are considered optimistic by some analysts, with revenue increases expected from the lack of a fix to the AMT and the expiration of tax cuts in 2010. The expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts at the end of 2010 would significantly increase revenues compared to limiting AMT expansion and extending tax cuts. Alternative scenarios show a less optimistic fiscal outlook than CBO baseline projections, with deficits growing from FY2007 to FY2017 under selected alternative policies. The deficit would increase from 1.7% of GDP in FY2008 to 3.6% of GDP in FY2017 under these alternative policies. The deficit would increase from 1.7% of GDP in FY2008 to 3.6% of GDP in FY2017. CBO projected larger deficits than the Administration for subsequent years. The House- and Senate-passed budget resolutions included deficits and surpluses for FY2008 and FY2012. The conference agreement on the budget resolution had a deficit of $252 billion in FY2008, becoming a surplus of $41 billion in FY2012. Figure 5 shows deficit or surplus estimates as shares of GDP for FY2007 through FY2017. The data from FY2007 to FY2017 includes deficit or surplus estimates as shares of GDP, with projections by CBO and OMB. The President's policy proposals involve additional defense spending, tight controls on domestic discretionary spending, and changes to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. The proposed defense budget only includes minimal war funding in FY2009. Projections show a rapid decline in the deficit, with a slight surplus expected in FY2012. CBO and OMB deficit projections extend to FY2017, showing an improving federal fiscal situation. The OMB and CBO projections show an improving federal fiscal situation, with deficits falling in proportion to the economy. However, alternative CBO projections based on different policy assumptions depict a steady deterioration in fiscal conditions, with deficits reaching 3.6% of GDP by FY2017. Economists argue that these alternative assumptions provide a more realistic view of future fiscal trends. The current mix of federal fiscal policies is deemed unsustainable in the long term due to the aging population and rising healthcare costs. The federal government's spending on programs for the elderly is projected to increase significantly, leading to rising deficits and a spiraling federal debt burden. Maintaining current fiscal policies would require drastic cuts in all spending except for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. By 2030, spending on these programs is expected to reach 15% of GDP, necessitating significant budget cuts in other areas to keep overall spending at 20% of GDP. The United States will face challenges in managing its fiscal policy as the baby-boom generation retires. In the next half-century, the United States will need to address fiscal challenges due to the retirement of the baby-boom generation. Aging population and rising healthcare costs will increase demand for resources to fund mandatory programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Achieving fiscal stability will require reducing spending growth and possibly increasing taxes. By 2050, spending on these entitlement programs is projected to exceed 15% of GDP, posing a significant burden on the budget in the long term. The long-term fiscal challenges facing the federal government are primarily driven by Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs. Estimates show a smaller fiscal gap for Social Security compared to Medicare, with projections sensitive to assumptions about productivity growth and medical inflation. Unexpected events like economic downturns can impact short-term budget outlook, but long-term budget sustainability will depend on policy, demographics, and healthcare costs. The long-term budget outlook for the federal government is heavily influenced by policy, demographics, and healthcare costs. The retirement of the baby boom generation and rising healthcare expenses will strain federal programs for the elderly, potentially overwhelming the budget. Without policy changes, these programs could limit the government's flexibility and hinder economic growth."
