The \"Fairness and Equity Tax Act of 1995\" imposes a minimum tax on certain corporations based on their business activities and foreign ownership. The taxable income of these corporations must meet specific requirements, with exceptions available if approved by the Secretary. Subsection (a) does not apply to determine taxable income if a qualified section 482 agreement is in effect with the corporation for a specific category of business activities. A qualified section 482 agreement is an agreement between the Secretary and the corporation regarding transactions with related parties in a specific category of business activities. The Secretary may enter into such an agreement if it will result in a clear reflection of the corporation's taxable income. The Secretary may give retroactive effect to a qualified section 482 agreement for prior taxable years if deemed necessary. In cases where activities cannot be categorized, a minimum tax of 35 percent is imposed on gross receipts. The tax is equal to 35 percent of the gross receipts from the sale or leasing of property manufactured by the taxpayer or related foreign parties. The Secretary may waive the tax in cases of casualty or disaster. Foreign taxes are not considered in determining taxable income. The Secretary prescribes an applicable profit percentage for different business activities each year. The applicable profit percentage for different business activities is based on the average earnings rates of domestic corporations. Earnings rate is calculated as the ratio of adjusted book income to gross receipts. Adjusted book income excludes certain taxes imposed by the US, US possessions, or foreign countries. Definitions and special rules apply to this tax section. Definitions and special rules apply to the tax section, including the terms '25-percent foreign-owned', 'foreign person', and 'related party' as defined in section 6038A(c). A corporation has substantial foreign-related person transactions if the transactions with foreign related parties exceed $2,000,000 or 10% of gross income. Business activities are categorized based on the Standard Industrial Classification Code. The Secretary may aggregate 2 or more 3-digit classifications and use a classification system other than the Standard Industrial Classification Code when appropriate. A clerical amendment is made to the table of parts for subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code. The amendments in Part VIII apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 1995."
