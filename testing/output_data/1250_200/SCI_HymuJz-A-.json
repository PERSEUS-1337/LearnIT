    "content": "The limitations of modern machine vision algorithms in learning visual relations are highlighted through controlled experiments. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) struggle with visual-relation problems when intra-class variability exceeds their capacity. Relational networks (RNs) also face similar limitations in abstract visual reasoning tasks. Feedback mechanisms like working memory and attention are proposed as key components for successful visual reasoning. The deep convolutional neural network accurately classifies a flute in a complex image, surpassing human accuracy on the ImageNet challenge. However, it struggles to recognize a simple relation in a binary image with two curves, highlighting the limitations of modern machine vision algorithms in learning visual relations. The limitations of modern machine vision algorithms in learning visual relations are highlighted by the struggle to recognize a simple relation in a binary image with two curves, despite accurately classifying a flute in a complex image. This failure is evident in both convolutional neural networks and relational networks, with the latter only being tested on toy datasets. The limitations of modern computer vision algorithms in recognizing visual relations across different species have been highlighted. Previous studies have shown that existing models struggle with visual reasoning tasks, such as the synthetic visual reasoning test (SVRT). Despite extensive training data, black-box classifiers and CNN architectures have failed to solve many SVRT problems. Additionally, CNNs have also struggled with learning simple same-different tasks, requiring carefully engineered training schedules. The limitations of CNNs in solving visual-relation tasks have been highlighted, leading to the question of whether it is due to poor hyperparameters or a systematic failure of feedforward models. The proposal is to test the limits of CNNs and other visual reasoning networks on these tasks. It is suggested that brain mechanisms like working memory and attention are crucial for visual reasoning, and current computer vision models may need to incorporate these feedback mechanisms to tackle complex tasks efficiently. The curr_chunk discusses the need for feedback mechanisms in computer vision models to solve complex visual reasoning tasks. It presents a systematic analysis of CNN architectures on SVRT problems, highlighting the dichotomy between visual-relation problems. The challenge aims to motivate the computer vision community to reconsider existing visual question answering challenges and seek inspiration from neuroscience and cognitive science for designing visual reasoning architectures. The curr_chunk discusses how CNNs perform on SVRT problems, showing lower accuracies on same-different problems compared to spatial-relation problems. Different stimuli depict simple black curves on a white background. CNNs were tested on various hyper-parameter combinations, with a single problem requiring detection of both same-different and spatial relations simultaneously. The study tested CNNs on SVRT problems, with lower accuracies on same-different tasks compared to spatial-relation tasks. Different stimuli were used, and various hyper-parameter combinations were tested. One problem required detecting both same-different and spatial relations simultaneously. The study analyzed CNN performance on SVRT problems, categorizing them into Same-Different (SD) and Spatial-Relation (SR) tasks based on problem descriptions. CNNs struggled more with SD tasks than SR tasks, with some SD problems resulting in accuracy barely above chance. This difficulty with SD tasks aligns with previous evidence of a visual-relation dichotomy. Hyperparameter search showed that SR problems were generally learned equally well across all network configurations. Our hyperparameter search revealed that SR problems are generally equally well-learned across all network configurations, with less than 10% difference in final accuracy between the worst-case and the best-case. Larger networks yielded significantly higher accuracy on SD problems than smaller ones. Experiment 1 corroborates previous studies, showing feedforward models performed poorly on visual-relation problems. The SVRT challenge has limitations as it only represents a small sample of all possible visual relations. There are connections between Figure 3: Sample PSVRT images showing different joint categories of SD and SR. Images are categorized as Same or Different and Horizontal or Vertical based on specific criteria. Problems vary in structure, making direct comparisons challenging. For example, Problem 2 requires a specific object configuration conflicting with Problem 1's requirements. The PSVRT challenge addresses issues with SVRT by creating a new dataset with two idealized problems: Spatial Relations (SR) and... The new dataset for the PSVRT challenge includes two idealized problems: Spatial Relations (SR) and Same-Different (SD). The image generator creates gray-scale images using square binary bit patterns on a blank background, controlled by parameters for item size, image size, and number of items. The PSVRT challenge dataset includes parameters for image variability at the item level, such as image size and number of items. The number of items controls both item and spatial variability, with SD and SR category labels determined based on item characteristics. Each image is generated with a joint class label for SD and SR, creating a parametric nature for the image samples. Parametric SVRT, or PSVRT, involves generating images with joint class labels for Same-Different (SD) and Spatial-Relation (SR) categories. The images are created by sampling SD and SR labels, generating unique items, and placing them in an image with background spacing. The goal is to examine the difficulty of learning PSVRT problems with varying image variability parameters. A baseline architecture was established for learning SD and SR PSVRT problems with specific parameter configurations, and instances of this architecture were trained for different combinations of item size, image size, and item number. For each combination of item size, image size, and item number, an instance of the baseline CNN architecture was trained from scratch to measure training-to-acquisition (TTA) accuracy. Three sub-experiments were conducted by varying image parameters separately to assess learnability. The baseline CNN was trained with 20 million images and a batch size of 50, reporting the minimum TTA for each experimental condition. The baseline CNN was trained with 20 million images using a batch size of 50. It had four convolution and pool layers, followed by four fully-connected layers. Different kernel sizes were used in the convolution layers, with pool layers in between. Dropout was applied in the last fully-connected layer. An ADAM optimizer with a base learning rate of 10^-4 was used. The effect of network size on learnability was also examined with a larger network control. A strong dichotomy in learning curves was observed across all conditions. The study examined the impact of network size on learnability using a baseline CNN with 20 million images. A strong dichotomy in learning curves was observed, with a sudden rise in accuracy to 95% termed as the \"learning event\". The final accuracy showed a bi-modality - either chance-level or close to 100%. In all conditions, the learning event occurred immediately after training began. In SR, no straining effect was found across all image parameters. The learning event occurred immediately after training began, reaching 95% accuracy soon after. In SD, a significant straining effect was observed with image size and number of items. Increasing image size led to longer TTA and decreased likelihood of learning. The network struggled to learn on larger images and with more items. Relaxing the same-different rule did not improve learning outcomes. The relaxation of the strict same-different rule significantly increased the number of matching images in the dataset, putting a strain on CNNs due to the exponential increase in image variability with larger image sizes and more items. This strain was observed across different network widths but was delayed by one step with larger image sizes. Increasing item size did not have a noticeable effect on CNN performance. The study found that increasing item size did not affect the performance of CNNs, indicating that they are building a feature set tailored for a specific dataset rather than learning a general rule. This suggests that CNNs are able to learn features that capture visual relations without being sensitive to irrelevant image variations. The Relational Network (RN) is an architecture designed to detect visual relations and outperforms a baseline CNN on various visual reasoning problems. It sits on top of a CNN, learning a map from pairs of high-level CNN feature vectors to answers to relational questions. The RN can be trained end-to-end and was found to beat a CNN on tasks like \"sort-of-CLEVR\" in VQA. The Relational Network (RN) outperforms a baseline CNN on visual reasoning problems like \"sort-of-CLEVR\" in VQA tasks. RN can be trained end-to-end and excels in answering relational and non-relational questions using simple 2D items in scenes. The sort-of-CLEVR tasks have limitations due to low item variability, leading to rote memorization of item configurations. To assess RN performance without these limitations, it was trained on a two-item same-different task and PSVRT stimuli. The model was trained on a two-item same-different task and PSVRT stimuli to assess its performance without limitations from sort-of-CLEVR tasks. The architecture details included a convolutional network with four layers and a relational network with multiple MLP layers. The final layer output was passed through a softmax. The model used ReLu activations in all fully connected layers except the last one, with 50% dropout in the penultimate layer. It employed a softmax function and was trained with cross-entropy loss using an ADAM optimizer. The architecture and training procedure were similar to the original authors' work, achieving results on the sort-of-CLEVR task. Twelve versions of the dataset were created, each missing a color+shape combination. The CNN+RN architecture was trained to detect sameness in two-item scenes, with learning stopping at 95% training accuracy. The CNN+RN model did not generalize well to left-out color+shape combinations on the sort-of-CLEVR task. Despite learning quickly, the model struggled to transfer its abilities to unseen conditions, even when attributes were present in the training set. The study found that the CNN+RN model performed like a vanilla CNN, achieving over 95% accuracy for image sizes of 120 pixels or below. However, the system did not learn for image sizes of 150 and 180 pixels, suggesting a limitation in the model's representational capacity for some tasks. This indicates that visual-relation problems can exceed the capabilities of CNNs. Our study shows that while CNNs can learn templates for individual objects, learning templates for object arrangements becomes challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of templates needed. This limitation in representing stimuli with a combinatorial structure is overlooked in computer vision, unlike in biological visual systems which excel at detecting relations. Humans can learn complex visual rules and generalize them from few examples, unlike CNNs which struggle with such tasks. In Experiment 1, problem 20 involves complex shapes and requires visual reasoning abilities. Despite training with a million examples, the best network could not perform significantly above chance. Animals like birds and primates can also learn same-different relations quickly, as shown by ducklings in a one-shot learning experiment. This suggests that animals can grasp abstract concepts from a single example. The behavior of ducklings in one-shot learning experiments suggests they can quickly grasp abstract concepts like same and different from a single example. In contrast, CNN+RN in Experiment 3 struggled to transfer this concept to novel objects even after extensive training. There is evidence that visual-relation detection in the brain may rely on feedback signals in addition to feedforward processes. Despite the presence of feedback connections in the visual cortex, some visual recognition tasks can be accomplished with minimal feedback, primarily through a single feedforward sweep of activity. The processing of spatial relations between objects in cluttered scenes requires attention and working memory. Neuroscience evidence suggests that object localization in clutter cannot be achieved solely through feedforward processes. Working memory plays a role in tasks requiring spatial and same-different reasoning. The computational role of attention and working memory in detecting visual relations involves constructing flexible representations dynamically through attention shifts, rather than storing templates statically. Humans excel in detecting visual relations and constructing structured descriptions effortlessly, highlighting the importance of exploring attentional and mnemonic mechanisms in visual reasoning."
