    "content": "Under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, both state and federal governments are prohibited from denying equal protection of the laws. Courts apply different levels of scrutiny based on the classification involved, with strict scrutiny being the most demanding form of review. This heightened scrutiny increases the likelihood of a court finding the government's action unconstitutional. Strict scrutiny is the most demanding form of judicial review, applying to governmental classifications that are constitutionally suspect or interfere with fundamental rights. It is triggered by classifications based on race, national origin, and alienage. Courts consider historical discrimination, unchangeable minority status, or inadequate political protection to determine suspect classifications. The government must prove that its actions are narrowly tailored to a compelling interest and cannot be achieved through less discriminatory means. Intermediate scrutiny is less stringent than strict scrutiny but more rigorous than rational basis review. Intermediate scrutiny is less searching than strict scrutiny but more stringent than rational basis review. It applies to \"quasi-suspect\" classifications like gender or illegitimacy. Courts assess if the action is substantially related to an important government interest. The government must prove the constitutional validity of its actions under intermediate scrutiny. Rational basis review is the least searching form of scrutiny, applying to classifications not subject to heightened levels. Governmental action must be rationally related to a legitimate interest to survive rational basis review. Courts consider the legitimacy of any possible governmental purpose behind the action. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees are found in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, prohibiting the government from depriving individuals of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Rational basis review is deferential to the government, requiring only a reasonable way of achieving a legitimate government purpose. Parties challenging governmental actions bear the burden of proving their invalidity under this standard. The Fourteenth Amendment applies to state action, ensuring that the government cannot deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property without following specific procedures. Substantive due process protects fundamental rights from undue government interference, subjecting such actions to strict scrutiny. This means the government must show a compelling interest and tailor its actions narrowly to meet that interest. The Supreme Court has recognized fundamental rights, including the right to have children, use contraception, and marry. In Obergefell v. Hodges, the Court ruled that state same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional, citing the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive due process and equal protection principles. In Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court declared state same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional, citing due process and equal protection principles. The decision was based on the fundamental right to marry, emphasizing individual autonomy, support for committed unions, child safeguarding, and marriage's role in society. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, departing from precedent by acknowledging that rights are not solely defined by historical practices. The Court emphasized that rights also evolve with a better understanding of constitutional imperatives, allowing new groups to exercise fundamental rights. The Court extended the right to marry to same-sex couples, departing from precedent by not applying strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans. The Court did not address whether the bans were narrowly tailored to the states' justifications, invalidating these reasons without applying typical levels of judicial review. The Court held that both equal protection and due process guarantees protect the fundamental right to marry. The Court in Obergefell extended the right to marry to same-sex couples, stating that states can no longer deny this right. The Court did not specify the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation, leading to dissent from some Justices who believed the issue should have been resolved through the democratic process. The dissenting Justices also criticized the majority for establishing a fundamental right not rooted in tradition and history. The dissenting Justices in Obergefell criticized the majority for establishing a fundamental right not rooted in tradition and history. The decision raised questions about its broader impact on the rights of gay individuals, the level of judicial scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation, and the Court's approach to recognizing fundamental rights. The Obergefell decision focused on the fundamental right to marry for same-sex couples, without addressing the broader implications for gay individuals outside of marriage. The Court did not discuss whether classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny, which could have had wider implications for gay rights. The U.S. Courts of Appeals have differing views on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Ninth and Second Circuits consider them quasi-suspect, warranting intermediate scrutiny, while the Sixth Circuit only applies rational basis review. The Obergefell decision focused on the right to marry for same-sex couples, leaving the issue of scrutiny for sexual orientation classifications unresolved. Lower courts will need to address this ambiguity in the future. The ambiguity in the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation among U.S. Courts of Appeals could lead to varying outcomes for laws facing constitutional challenges. Some circuits apply heightened scrutiny, while others use rational basis review. This discrepancy may result in different rulings on similar laws, creating uncertainty in the legal landscape. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about extending the right to marry to polygamy, with Chief Justice John Roberts suggesting it could lead to the legalization of plural marriages. However, the majority's opinion in Obergefell seems crafted to limit its reach to same-sex marriage, preventing the extension of the fundamental right to marry to plural marriages. Some commentators believe there are enough distinctions between plural and same-sex marriages to prevent Obergefell's rationale from legalizing plural marriage. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about extending the right to marry to polygamy, with Chief Justice John Roberts suggesting it could lead to the legalization of plural marriages. However, the majority in Obergefell departed from precedent by considering individual autonomy and family in the context of same-sex marriage, potentially opening the door for extending constitutional protections to plural marriages. The Court's failure to clarify the level of judicial review applied to state same-sex marriage bans further complicates the issue. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about extending the right to marry to polygamy, with Chief Justice John Roberts suggesting it could lead to the legalization of plural marriages. The Court's failure to clarify the level of judicial review applied to state same-sex marriage bans creates ambiguity regarding governmental action infringing upon fundamental rights."
