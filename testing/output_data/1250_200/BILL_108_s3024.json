It also authorizes the creation of regional centers for transportation solutions and provides for the authorization of appropriations. Congress finds that research and development are crucial for a transportation system that meets safety, mobility, economic vitality, efficiency, equity, and environmental protection goals. Despite a 40% increase in overall transportation funding, resources for transportation research have remained stagnant. There is a need for more funding and a focus on long-term strategic research through competitive, peer-reviewed awards. The diversity of transportation research programs poses challenges in addressing the needs of different customers. The diversity of transportation research programs poses challenges in addressing the needs of different customers. To ensure the United States transportation system meets safety, mobility, economic vitality, equity, and environmental protection goals, increasing federal investment in long-range transportation planning, supporting competitive research, coordinating research programs, and fostering interchange of transportation are essential.

The northeast regional center will be located in one of the top 5 states with high traffic congestion on National Highway System roads. The United States measures traffic congestion based on the ratio of annual vehicle miles traveled on National Highway System roads to the number of lane miles in each state. States with high congestion levels are determined by the ratio of urban road miles to urban lane miles. Authorization of appropriations from the Highway Trust Fund for fiscal years 2006 to 2010: $50,000,000 in 2006, $100,000,000 in 2007, $150,000,000 in 2008, $200,000,000 in 2009, and $250,000,000 in 2010."
