    "content": "Public and private health care spending is increasing due to factors like rising enrollment in health insurance and demographic changes. The tax subsidies provided in the Internal Revenue Code for private and publicly provided health care are often overlooked in budget discussions. These subsidies, known as tax expenditures, confer preferential tax status to certain forms of income, resulting in foregone revenue. Congressional attention to health-related tax expenditures raises questions about their value, changes over time, impact of the ACA, and comparison to total revenue collected. This report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditure estimates published by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to understand changes in health tax expenditures relative to total revenue collected and federal support for health programs. It focuses on tax expenditures at the budget function level and provides insights into the growth of federal support for health through direct outlays or revenue losses attributable to tax expenditures. For more detailed information on individual tax expenditures, refer to CRS Committee Print CP10001 and CRS Report R44012. Tax expenditures are defined as revenue losses from provisions in Federal tax laws that allow special exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, preferential tax rates, or deferrals. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) uses a modified Haig-Simons baseline definition of income to estimate tax expenditures, focusing on revenue forgone from the income tax system. JCT's estimates only include revenue losses from the income tax system, not other forms of taxation. Tax expenditures are revenue losses from provisions in Federal tax laws that allow special exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, preferential tax rates, or deferrals. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates tax expenditures based on revenue forgone from the income tax system, categorizing provisions by budget function such as health, commerce, housing, and energy. The Department of the Treasury also lists tax expenditures by budget function, with JCT's health budget function being broader than that used for outlays by agencies like the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). This broader categorization is due to historical practices and the complexity of containing cross-cutting health provisions within narrow categories. Tax expenditures are categorized by budget area and forms outlined in the 1974 Budget Act. Economists evaluate them based on economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity. They can impact economic distortions and certain groups of people. For example, tax expenditures in health insurance can correct some market inefficiencies while creating others. Tax expenditures in health insurance can correct some market inefficiencies while creating others. Tax benefits are based on the top marginal income tax rate faced by the filer. Administering social programs through the tax code may benefit lower-income households but could increase complexity and costs. JCT currently identifies 14 health tax expenditures. In FY2016, health tax expenditures are estimated to amount to $234.0 billion. The largest tax expenditure is the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), which is also the largest in the federal tax code. From FY2015 to FY2019, the annual tax expenditure for ESI is projected to increase from $145.5 billion to $169.4 billion. The second largest health tax expenditure is for subsidies for insurance purchased in the exchanges, with an estimated increase from $29.6 billion to $84.8 billion from FY2015 to FY2019. The tax expenditure amount for Advanced Premium Tax Credits (APTCs) is projected to increase from $29.6 billion to $84.8 billion from FY2015 to FY2019. Various health-related tax provisions subsidize private health insurance costs or activities with positive societal benefits. Some provisions have historical origins in legal doctrine or income definitions, indirectly influenced by other policies. The tax treatment of various activities, such as charitable giving, has evolved over time with origins dating back to the early 1900s. The exclusion of employer-sponsored health coverage from income was significantly expanded post-World War II. JCT data on health-related tax expenditures from FY1974 to FY2019 show the growth in these provisions. The analysis of JCT data on health-related tax expenditure estimates from FY1974 to FY2019 shows changes in the number of provisions over time. Multiple tax expenditure provisions are combined to track changes in this budget function, excluding provisions with de minimus value. After adjusting for inflation, health-related tax expenditures have increased over time. From FY2004 to FY2014, these expenditures increased by 43.0% in real terms. The annual tax expenditure value for health-related provisions has increased by 11.5% in nominal dollars from FY1974 to FY2014. The growth of health-related tax expenditures can be attributed to factors like changes in demographics. In FY2019, health tax expenditures are estimated to reach $296.2 billion in nominal dollars. The net growth of health-related tax expenditures, estimated at $234.0 billion, is influenced by factors like changes in demographics, health care costs, and policy changes. Medicare-related tax expenditures increased over time, with Medicare Part D showing a positive tax expenditure. Medicare-related tax expenditures increased over time, with annual values rising by 10.2% (nominal) and 7.7% (real) from FY1987 to FY2014. JCT estimated these expenditures to be 26.8% of total health tax expenditures in FY2014, showing a trend of growth exceeding total revenue collections. Tax expenditures in the health sector have been increasing faster than total revenue collections. Health tax expenditures are projected to rise from 6.4% of total revenue in FY2015 to 7.7% in FY2019. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) introduced various taxes to raise revenue, including the Cadillac tax, individual mandate, employer mandate, and medical device tax. Despite these revenue-raising measures, the revenue generated is small compared to the overall value of health tax expenditures. The comparison between federal health outlays and tax expenditures can track support to the health sector over time. Medicare and Medicaid costs are mostly mandatory outlays, with administrative costs funded as discretionary spending. Federal health research and veterans' health care are also significant expenses. The comparison between federal health outlays and tax expenditures shows that health-related tax expenditures historically exceeded health discretionary outlays, but were still much less than health mandatory outlays. Mandatory outlays for health have increased over time, while health-related tax expenditures have also grown. Health discretionary outlays have remained relatively stable as a percentage of GDP. This information is detailed in the appendix with a description of each health tax expenditure provision. The report provides a brief description and legislative origins of health tax expenditure provisions identified by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). These provisions, some of which are long-standing in the Internal Revenue Code, may have had different historical rationales for their creation.
