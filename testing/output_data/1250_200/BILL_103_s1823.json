    "content": "The \"Video Game Rating Act of 1994\" aims to provide parents with information about video games used in homes or public areas. It defines video games and video devices as interactive computer games in interstate commerce and the video game industry as manufacturers of video games. The Act establishes the Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission. The Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission (the \"Commission\") is established as an independent executive branch establishment. It consists of 5 members appointed by the President, with no more than 3 members affiliated with the same political party. The Chairman is designated by the President, and all members serve until the Commission's termination. Vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, and the Chairman is compensated at a rate equivalent to the minimum annual pay for level IV of the Executive Schedule. The Chairman of the Commission is compensated at a rate equivalent to level IV of the Executive Schedule, while other members are paid at a rate equivalent to level V. The Chairman can appoint an executive director and additional staff without following civil service laws, with their compensation determined by the Chairman. The Commission may hire an executive director subject to confirmation, set their compensation, and hire consultants as needed. Funding is authorized for the Commission's duties, with a user fee to be set. The Commission will set a user fee to reimburse the United States for its expenses. It will terminate by December 31, 1996, or 90 days after establishing adequate voluntary standards for warning about violent or sexually explicit video game content. The Commission has authority and functions related to setting user fees and establishing voluntary standards for warning about violent or sexually explicit video game content. The Commission is tasked with coordinating with the video game industry to develop voluntary standards for informing purchasers about the content of video games, particularly violence or sexually explicit material. After a year, they will evaluate the industry's proposed standards to determine if they adequately warn users and parents about such content. If deemed sufficient, the Commission will enforce these voluntary standards. The Commission will submit a report to the President and Congress after determining the adequacy of voluntary industry standards for informing purchasers about violence or sexually explicit content in video games. They may also enforce regulations requiring manufacturers and sellers to provide this information to users. Antitrust laws do not apply to joint efforts in the video game industry to create voluntary guidelines for informing purchasers about the content of video games, as long as it does not result in a boycott."
