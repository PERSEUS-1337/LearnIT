    "content": "The President's gravest decision is directing the use of nuclear weapons through Nuclear Command and Control (NC2) and the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS), which provide the infrastructure for planning, directing, and controlling nuclear weapon operations. The NCCS supports the President's authority over nuclear weapons operations and may warrant Congressional oversight. Congress reviews DOD's plans to sustain and modernize the NCCS, with potential for revisiting its structure and relevance. Despite its Cold War origins, the NCCS may still be needed due to potential nuclear challenges from China, North Korea, or Iran. The NCCS, formed by the National Military Command System (NMCS), faces potential nuclear challenges from China, North Korea, or Iran. The report will discuss NCCS platforms, their current role in light of past reviews, and proposed modernization initiatives. Despite its strategic importance, the NCCS receives little attention outside the military establishment. The National Military Command System (NMCS) is the priority component of the Global Command and Control System, providing command and control for the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff. It includes the National Military Command Center (NMCC) as the primary location for national command and control, monitoring nuclear forces and military operations. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) serves as a survivable airborne backup to the NMCC's command and control capabilities. It consists of modified Boeing 747-200B aircraft with hardened communications against Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP). USSTRATCOM provides personnel and administration, while the Air Force's Air Combat Command manages resources. Site-R at Fort Ritchie, Maryland, can be activated as an alternate NMCC. The USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center (GOC) at Offutt AFB, Nebraska serves as a backup to the NMCC for emergency actions and day-to-day management. It is protected against EMP and staffed 24/7 by Senior Controllers. The USSTRATCOM Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) provides a survivable airborne backup with modified Boeing 707 aircraft. The ABNCPs are modified Boeing 707 aircraft serving as a survivable airborne backup. Each aircraft carries a crew of 22, including aircrew, communications operators, and battlestaff personnel led by an Airborne Emergency Action Officer. The aircraft fulfills key missions as the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) and the Take Charge And Move Out (TACAMO) relay for Navy ballistic missile submarines. It can communicate using VLF/LF, UHF, or EHF satellite systems. The aircraft, aircrew, and communications operators are from the Navy's Strategic Communications Wing One based at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma. The operators from the Navy's Strategic Communications Wing One at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, are part of the USSTRATCOM Mobile Consolidated Command Center (MCCC), a convoy of trucks that serves as a backup to the USSTRATCOM GOC or ABNCP. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is designed to provide advice and decision-making support to the President for strategic nuclear forces, including situation monitoring for potential crises. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) includes intelligence systems for anticipating crises and monitoring situations like weather. Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (TW/AA) involves quickly detecting and analyzing potential attacks using dual phenomenology. Decision making on employing nuclear weapons involves consultation with senior commanders and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The President, advised by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, consults with other advisors for decision-making on employing nuclear weapons. The system ensures connectivity between the President, advisors, and nuclear commanders for updated information. Force management involves readiness data for nuclear deterrent forces, while force direction includes controls for preventing unauthorized use of nuclear weapons. Nuclear surety involves controls to prevent unauthorized use of nuclear weapons, including positive control and force direction. The National Military Command System must be survivable and reliable to ensure connectivity between decision makers and forces during critical events. The National Military Command System (NCCS) must be reliable, secure, and able to prevent unauthorized access or interference. Nuclear command and control is crucial for deterrence, as highlighted in the DOD's 2001 Nuclear Posture Review directed by Congress. The curr_chunk discusses the United States' nuclear deterrence policy, including the levels and composition of nuclear delivery systems, the nuclear weapons complex, and the nuclear weapons stockpile. Assistant Secretary Crouch highlighted the need for changes in the multinational environment driving the National Military Command System's reliability and security in the post-Cold War era. Assistant Secretary Crouch emphasized the need for changes in the multinational environment post-Cold War, focusing on reducing dependence on offensive nuclear forces for deterrence. The NPR highlighted potential threats from the proliferation of WMDs and ballistic missiles, leading to a \"capabilities based approach\" for a new triad of capabilities to tailor national responses to adversaries. The NPR introduces a \"new triad\" of capabilities, consisting of nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces, active and passive defenses, and a responsive weapons infrastructure. The Administration emphasizes command, control, intelligence, and planning at the center of the new triad to enhance precision, adaptability, and integration of forces for improved deterrence and operational effectiveness. This focus on NC2 capabilities could lead to the development of new systems. The Bush Administration and the Department of Defense are implementing the framework of the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), with USSTRATCOM taking on additional missions such as global strike, space operations, missile defense, and combating weapons of mass destruction. General James Cartwright established a Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction in September 2005. General James Cartwright established a Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction in September 2005, in partnership with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. The Department of Defense is incorporating the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review into its doctrinal guidance, with a focus on deterring and responding to the use of weapons of mass destruction. The draft update to the \"Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations\" emphasizes crisis action planning and integration of nuclear and non-nuclear forces. The draft update to the \"Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations\" may have been cancelled. The new joint doctrine would focus on rapid crisis action planning to respond to unanticipated WMD threats, emphasizing the need for quick development and dissemination of plans to nuclear forces during a crisis. This could require growth in computer workstation capability, increases in communications capacity, and integration with other military operations. Air forces are adapting to the need for daily Air Tasking Order dissemination in combat theaters. Networked planning systems are becoming standard, including for nuclear planning. Senior leaders require bandwidth-heavy video-teleconferencing for long-distance deliberations. Robust communications are crucial for coordination with intelligence providers on WMD targets. A 12-member commission was appointed by Congress to review the 2001 NPR implementation, focusing on programmatic requirements and NC2. The commission must submit its report by June 30, 2007, potentially advancing the debate on NPR implementation. The NPR commission appointed by Congress is tasked with reviewing the 2001 NPR implementation, focusing on programmatic requirements and NC2. The NPR suggests using precision non-nuclear weapons to reduce the need for nuclear weapons, but the presence of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal is likely to continue. The shape of the required command and control architecture for nuclear weapons policy will be determined by an overarching approach. Today's nuclear command and control systems were mostly developed during the Cold War, with the NORAD-Cheyenne Mountain Complex becoming operational in 1966 and the E-4 National Airborne Operations Center delivered in 1974. The NORAD-Cheyenne Mountain Complex, E-4 National Airborne Operations Center, and USSTRATCOM underground command post were built during the Cold War to manage nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union. The post-Cold War environment may require new NC2 infrastructure due to evolving threats, such as decapitation attacks targeting leadership. The Defense Department is evaluating if the current infrastructure is still appropriate today. The concern over decapitation attacks targeting national and military leadership during the Cold War shaped upgrades to nuclear command and control systems in the 1980s. The threat of such attacks from Russia today is considerably diminished, with U.S. policy no longer considering the relationship adversarial. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty committed both sides to reduce deployed nuclear weapons. The Moscow Treaty, signed in 2002 by Presidents Bush and Putin, aimed to reduce deployed nuclear weapons to 1,700-2,200 levels. Despite the Cold War's end, concerns remain about potential nuclear threats, including from China. Chinese military expenditures could triple by 2025, with advanced systems like the mobile DF-31A ICBM posing a threat to the U.S. General Zhu Chenghu of China's National Defense University has even threatened nuclear attacks on U.S. cities. General Zhu Chenghu of China's National Defense University threatened nuclear attacks on U.S. cities if the U.S. intervened in Taiwan. Analysts have differing views on China's threat, with some suggesting China aims for preeminence in the Pacific Rim while others argue the threat is overstated. The relationship with China is seen as more complex than the Cold War competition with the Soviet Union, with areas of cooperation existing. Some view the emphasis on a \"China threat\" as a search for a new great power competitor since the Cold War era. Some analysts warn of a potential threat from China's increasing nuclear capability, which could pose a survivability threat to the nuclear command and control system. Rogue states like Iran and North Korea, pursuing nuclear weapons, also reinforce the need for a viable NC2 architecture. North Korea has been actively seeking nuclear weapons since the 1960s, with A.Q. Khan possibly aiding Kim Jong Il's efforts. North Korea claimed to have nuclear weapons in 2005, but verification is challenging. North Korea publicly announced in 2005 that it had nuclear weapons, but verification is difficult. Estimates suggest they may have around ten bombs. North Korea also manufactures various missiles, but it is unclear if they can attach nuclear warheads. Reliable information on their capabilities is scarce, and some believe their claims are deceptive. The Iranian nuclear program also presents challenges for threat analysts. The Iranian nuclear program poses dilemmas for threat analysts as there are conflicting predictions on when Iran may acquire nuclear weapons. While some suggest it could happen within two years, others believe it may take up to ten years. Iran's activities at nuclear sites like Natanz have raised suspicions, with concerns about their development of long-range delivery systems. The secrecy surrounding their nuclear program has heightened suspicions. Iran's nuclear program raises concerns about their development of long-range delivery systems and potential hostile intentions. Reports suggest Iran is studying high explosives essential for constructing a nuclear weapon. Their rhetoric about destroying Israel and the US adds to worries. Small nuclear arsenals could pose a threat through an electromagnetic pulse, damaging infrastructure and causing widespread failures. The EMP Commission was established by Congress to assess the threat of an electromagnetic pulse attack on the US. Experts warn that a high altitude nuclear burst could lead to catastrophic failures in critical infrastructure, potentially causing the deaths of thousands or even millions. China, North Korea, and Iran are believed to be developing capabilities for such attacks. Recent North Korean and Iranian missile tests suggest preparation for launching short-range missiles from freighters off the U.S. coast. There is emerging technology for generating localized EMP bursts without nuclear detonation, but skepticism exists about the extent of the threat. Analysts argue that military and commercial systems may withstand EMP attacks with minimal impact, as key infrastructure and military systems have EMP protection. The motivation for China to use EMP against the U.S. is unclear. The EMP threat from rogue states like North Korea or Iran, as well as terrorist groups, is considered difficult due to challenges in developing a nuclear weapon capable of generating large area EMP effects. However, the EMP Commission has raised concerns about the decline in EMP hardening and practice in the military since the 1990s. Congress has directed the reestablishment of the EMP Commission to assess the vulnerability of military systems and progress in protecting them from EMP attacks. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review addresses new missions and challenges for the nuclear command and control system, including the integration of nuclear and non-nuclear forces. Implementation of NPR recommendations may require improvements in the command and control system to accommodate additional participants and enhance speed and responsiveness. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review highlights the need for improvements in the command and control system to accommodate additional participants and enhance speed and responsiveness for new missions and challenges. This includes the consideration of non-nuclear options such as precision weapons, conventional ballistic missiles, information operations, electronic warfare, energy weapons, and special operations forces strikes. The question of \"release authority\" for these non-nuclear options arises, as only the President can direct the release of nuclear weapons. The President's level of involvement in military operations varies, with historic exceptions like Lyndon Johnson's personal selection of targets during the Vietnam War. Typically, Presidents do not delve into planning specific conventional missions during existing hostilities. However, strategic targets that USSTRATCOM might respond to could warrant Presidential involvement, especially in the opening rounds of hostilities. Requiring Presidential authorization for these strikes could pose technical and operational challenges, as conventional weapons lack permissive action link codes like nuclear weapons. The complexity of ensuring only conventional weapons are launched, especially when mixed with nuclear weapons on the same platform, poses challenges. Non-kinetic strikes like cyber-attacks could have strategic impacts, potentially equivalent to WMD strikes. Some argue for increased Presidential control, but technical solutions for enforcing such control have not been discussed. The need for detailed involvement and control in non-nuclear and non-kinetic responses within the command and control process is highlighted. The addition of participants from other communities may require revisions in approval processes to prevent delays in decision-making and implementation. The integration of active defenses, like missile defenses, into the NC2 architecture will also require agreement on release authority and decisions on which locations to defend. Some analysts recommend delegating missile defense release authority to the unified combatant commander, possibly with standing Presidential guidance. Decision-making on defensive launches or offensive strikes may require Presidential consideration, with choreographed conversations needed to accommodate limited time frames. Defensive success could impact offensive response options, while overwhelming attacks may necessitate earlier offensive responses for damage limitation. Alternatively, an attack with the potential to overwhelm the defensive system may require an earlier offensive response for damage limitation. Regional combatant commanders will be responsible for defense in their area, with USSTRATCOM leading missile defense efforts linked to other regional commands. General Cartwright has directed personnel to ensure interoperable missile defense command and control systems. Defense command and control systems must be interoperable with common technical standards and protocols to handle increasing bandwidth demands. The system must present non-nuclear and defensive choices to the President in an easily understandable manner, aiding in decision-making within tight timelines without overwhelming him. It is crucial to maintain tight Presidential control of nuclear weapons and ensure clear and actionable orders reach weapons operators. The nuclear command and control systems are essential for maintaining tight Presidential control of nuclear weapons and ensuring clear and actionable orders reach weapons operators. These systems also support civilian and military leadership in nuclear operations and have the potential to serve multiple missions in non-nuclear roles, making them versatile national assets. For example, the National Military Command Center (NMCC) provides 24-hour monitoring of worldwide military operations and aids in managing peacetime contingencies like natural disasters. Additionally, response cells or crisis action teams can be formed to prepare orders, monitor forces, and deliver briefings during crises and conflicts. Command and control assets, including the NMCC and NORAD, play a crucial role in coordinating responses to crises and disasters. These assets support continuity of operations and government during domestic contingencies. For example, on September 11, 2001, President Bush utilized secure facilities like USSTRATCOM in Omaha to receive updates and communicate with his national security staff. Additionally, command and control assets at U.S. Northern Command were used to monitor the government response to Hurricane Rita. The President utilized command and control assets at U.S. Northern Command to monitor the government response to Hurricane Rita in September 2005. Nuclear command and control assets can support civil authorities after disasters. FEMA and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have an agreement to use the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) for FEMA support during disasters. Senior government leadership values these systems for their versatile capabilities. The NAOC is utilized by Secretary Rumsfeld for official travel and support during crises. Using NC2 assets for non-nuclear missions may lead to competition and shortfalls in response plans. Tying these systems to other agencies could force the military to sustain outdated systems, adding burdens on operators and decreasing readiness for primary missions. The burden on nuclear command and control systems increases with shrinking manpower pools. The 2001 End-to-End Review of the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System focused on survivability issues, highlighting the importance of maintenance and operator adherence to hardness procedures. The 2001 End-to-End Review emphasized the importance of maintenance and operator adherence to hardness procedures for nuclear command and control systems. It suggested shifting system life cycle management to operators and highlighted challenges with operator-generated requirements for new capabilities. The decline in NC2 expertise since the end of the Cold War has led to a decrease in the number of people with nuclear operations skills. This has resulted in a \"brain drain\" and a revolving door of personnel with expertise in critical disciplines. The legacy NC2 architecture faces challenges from the Defense Department's push for military transformation towards more network-oriented, distributed operations. US Strategic Command has established subordinate functional component commands for global strike, space operations, missile defense, information operations, and combating WMD, promoting decentralization and collaboration. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review proposes significant changes in NC2 programs to facilitate USSTRATCOM's move to distributed command and control capabilities. It recommends retiring expensive legacy mobile platforms like the E-4B NAOC aircraft and replacing them with C-32 aircraft. The new command and control capabilities must be survivable in the event of WMD, electronic, or cyber-warfare attacks, tailored specifically for WMD elimination missions. USSTRATCOM is studying implementation of an internet protocol (IP)-based communications architecture to link distributed locations for nuclear command and control. However, using an IP network may not provide the needed assurance for rapid message transmission, especially for high priority nuclear force direction messages. The communications bandwidth required for this expanded infrastructure is already at a premium, with a significant increase in demand expected in the next 10 years. The nuclear community faces a growing need for command and control links, with a potential 2500% increase in demand in the next 10 years. Coordination of new systems like missile defense into the network, certification requirements, compatibility, and procedures in a distributed architecture are key challenges. Procurement programs for upgrades to the nuclear command and control system are included in DOD's budget requests. The DOD's FY2006 and FY2007 budget requests include programs for upgrades and enhancements to the nuclear command and control system, focusing on the Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN). Funding was allocated for procurement and research and development (R&D) for modernization efforts within MEECN, such as high data rate terminals for command and control aircraft. Upgrades to the nuclear command and control system include improvements to secure computer terminals, satellite communications, and communication systems for bomber and tanker forces. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is personally involved in directing upgrades to the National Military Command System. This effort aims to consolidate separate command centers into two new centers in the Pentagon. The Pentagon is consolidating separate command centers into two new centers: a Unified Command Center and a Resources and Situation Awareness Center. These centers will track global crises, provide military advice to the President, and be more secure against threats. The Defense Department claims this consolidation will create efficiencies and allow for a reduction in manpower. Funding for this effort was approved by Congress for FY2006 and DOD is seeking additional funding for FY2007. In 2011, Congress authorized the full amount of DOD's request for FY2006, including funding for missile warning systems and airborne command and control platforms. DOD is seeking $0.7 million for FY2007 and $50.9 million for further research and development. The Defense Department also requested funds to enhance its airborne nuclear command and control platforms in FY2006. Congress funded these requests in the FY2006 Authorization. In FY2006, Congress authorized full funding for NAOC modifications, including $18.9 million for research and development. The FY2006 appropriations bill also funded the DOD request. For FY2007, DOD is requesting $5.6 million for E-4B modifications procurement and $283 thousand for R&D. The requests cover various improvements to aircraft systems and capabilities, such as digital audio equipment, secure communication services for senior leaders, LAN improvements, radio link upgrades, navigation enhancements, and integration with Global Air Traffic systems. Upgrades are also proposed for the E-6B fleet operated by the Navy. Upgrades for the E-6B fleet, operated by the Navy for USSTRATCOM, include precision navigation capability enhancements, integration with Global Air Traffic systems, improved cockpit displays, air traffic control integration systems, and mission system improvements. The requested modifications for FY2006 cost $11.2 million for procurement and $31.4 million for RDT&E. Congress fully supported the Navy's request in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act, matching the DOD's procurement funding and providing $35.5 million for R&D. For FY2007, the Defense Department is requesting $99.2 million for E-6 modifications procurement and $37.4 million for research and development. The Defense Department is requesting $99.2 million for E-6 modifications procurement and $37.4 million for research and development in FY2007. The Advanced EHF (AEHF) communications satellite program aims to replace the aging MILSTAR satellite constellation for secure, anti-jam communications. Lockheed Martin and Northrop-Grumman are contractors for the AEHF program. The Air Force requested $665.3 million in RDT&E and $529 million for procurement in FY2006, which was fully funded by Congress. The FY2006 Defense Authorization fully funded the Air Force budget request for AEHF, while the FY2006 Defense appropriations matched the DOD budget request. In FY2007, DOD did not request procurement funds as the satellites were already purchased, but the Air Force sought $633 million for AEHF R&D. The AEHF program has faced schedule delays and cost overruns, with technical shortfalls causing delays in the development of communications encryption equipment. The program's cost is now estimated to be over $7 billion, leading to a Nunn-McCurdy notification to Congress. AEHF is intended to bridge the gap between MILSTAR and the Transformational. The AEHF program has faced schedule delays and cost overruns, with a cost exceeding $7 billion, leading to a Nunn-McCurdy notification to Congress. Congress considered acquiring additional AEHF satellites and modifying Wideband Gapfiller satellites to bridge the gap in case of further TSAT delays. In FY2006, Congress reduced funding for TSAT by $400 million and directed the Air Force to focus on technology development. The nuclear command and control system will face challenges in the future due to increased demands driven by the 2001 NPR and DOD policy. The system's legacy Cold War architecture may compete for budget priority against more immediately relevant systems in today's threat environment. The NCCS plays key functions in maintaining the US nuclear deterrent, facing challenges in modernization amidst budget constraints. Questions arise regarding the nature of threats from China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorist organizations, shaping the system's configuration against potential worst-case scenarios. The role of nuclear weapons in U.S. strategy and its impact on command and control systems are debated. The current centralized system may need revisions to incorporate new requirements for non-nuclear responses and missile defense. Release authorities and architectural decisions may require legislative debate. A more dispersed approach, as proposed by USSTRATCOM, could be considered. The need for legislative debate on release authorities and architectural decisions precedes potential changes to the centralized nuclear command and control system. A more dispersed approach, like the one proposed by USSTRATCOM, could offer cost savings in the long term. However, the effectiveness of a distributed network style approach has not been tested. Questions remain about the level of investment needed for modernization and procurement, as well as the adequacy and necessity of existing NCCS platforms. The retirement of certain systems may provide short-term savings, but competition for resources with other military needs is a concern. The value of secondary uses of the NCCS and the potential for added taxpayer value are also considerations. The NCCS represents a national asset built up over decades. Can the taxpayer get added value by employing these capabilities for ancillary functions? Some platforms that provide support in homeland security and disaster response may have greater utility. Should investment in these systems continue if their primary mission requirements are superseded? Should procurement and operation be transferred to civilian agencies?"
