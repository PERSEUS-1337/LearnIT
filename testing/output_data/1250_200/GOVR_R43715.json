Airlines rely on this insurance for loan agreements, lease agreements, and to meet requirements of foreign countries. After 9/11, the U.S. government expanded the federal Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to ensure coverage for U.S. air carriers when the commercial market was unstable. Now, many airlines are purchasing war risk coverage from private insurers. The commercial insurance market has stabilized, with air carriers purchasing war risk coverage from private insurers. Private coverage is available for loss or damage to passengers and aircraft hulls in terrorist attacks, but coverage for third-party damage is limited. Airline insurance is a small percentage of total operating costs, with airlines paying approximately $2.3 billion in 2011. Insurance prices vary based on airline location, size, fleet age, safety record, network spread, and deductible levels. The private market capacity for aviation risk insurance is deemed adequate, but could change in the event of a major terrorist incident. The private market for aviation risk insurance is currently adequate, but could be impacted by a major terrorist incident. Commercial insurers provide war risk coverage to airlines, with availability and lower prices for non-war risk coverage in recent years. Airliner losses in 2014, such as Malaysia Airlines flights 370 and 17, and attacks on airports have raised concerns and may lead to increased insurance premiums. Some aviation insurers predict a significant increase in insurance premiums due to recent aviation losses and attacks on airports. The uncertainty remains on how the commercial market will react and if private coverage may become too expensive or unavailable, especially for U.S. air carriers flying to EU destinations. EU regulations mandate aviation-specific liability insurance, including war and terrorism risks, for all carriers operating within EU territory. EU regulations require all air carriers and aircraft operators flying within, into, out of, or over EU territory to have insurance for aviation-specific liabilities, including war and terrorism risks. This mandate also applies to non-EU carriers operating to and from the EU, even if their home countries do not require war risk insurance. The regulation has made war risk insurance mandatory for these carriers. Prior to 1951, aviation war risk insurance was commercially available but subject to 48-hour cancellation clauses, which proved worrisome for operators in the Korean War airlift. A 1951 law amended the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 to give the Secretary of Commerce authority to provide war risk insurance for U.S.- and foreign-flag aircraft operating in the interest of national defense or economy. Premium rates could be set by the Secretary of Commerce within defined bounds, with a revolving fund established to cover losses. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 established a revolving fund within the Treasury for war risk insurance, funded through premiums and recoveries from losses. Any liabilities covered under the insurance program would be disbursed by the Treasury. The program was later delegated to the FAA under the Department of Transportation in 1966. The hijacking incidents in 1968 and 1969 marked the beginning of an era of international terrorism. In August 1969, PFLP members hijacked a TWA flight from Rome to Athens, blowing up the nose section in Damascus and holding Israeli passengers hostage. In September 1970, PFLP hijackers attempted to hijack four airliners, successfully taking three to Dawson's Field in Jordan. The fate of the Pan Am 747 hijacked on September 6, 1970, is relevant to insurance coverage for terrorist acts. After hijacking a TWA flight in 1969, PFLP members redirected a Pan Am 747 to Beirut and Cairo in 1970. In Cairo, a hijacker detonated an explosive, destroying the jet. The aircraft was insured under various policies split between FAA and commercial insurers. The incident led to increased federal aviation war risk insurance coverage due to concerns over insuring Boeing 747s and terrorist hijackings in the Middle East. The government set the insurance rate at 20 cents per $100, double the commercial rate. The government set the insurance rate at 20 cents per $100 of insurance, offered under the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program in response to the Middle East crisis. A 1973 court decision ruled that the Pan Am 747 destroyed in Cairo by hijackers was covered under the airline's standard policy, not its war risk policies. The court defined \"act of war\" as an operation for military advantage, narrowing the definition of war to combatants with significant sovereignty attributes. The appellate court ruled that insurers offering \"all risk\" policies were liable for the claim on the destroyed aircraft involved in the hijackings in the Middle East. Prior to 9/11, war risk insurance was primarily issued without premiums under indemnification agreements with the Department of Defense, with premium insurance only available for specific foreign locations deemed necessary for U.S. foreign policy interests. During the first Gulf War in 1990 and 1991, air carriers faced soaring commercial war risk insurance rates, leading to flight cancellations to Middle Eastern destinations. Insurance premiums for flights to Israel increased significantly, causing some airlines to suspend flights to high-risk locations. Tower Air was the only U.S. carrier to continue operating flights from Israel during this time. During the first Gulf War, airlines faced high war risk insurance rates, leading to flight cancellations to the Middle East. Tower Air was the only U.S. carrier to continue flights from Israel. After 9/11, insurers canceled war risk coverage, prompting Congress to pass the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001, expanding coverage to include terrorism. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 extended the program. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 extended the program to include coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew. The current program authority expires on September 30, 2014. Rates were set to match commercial rates in force on the date of enactment on November 25, 2002. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, capped rates for air carriers and provided coverage for terrorism losses. Congress also passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 to create a reinsurance program for terrorism losses in the commercial insurance market. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, provided coverage for terrorism losses. As of January 2014, the FAA's Aviation War Risk Insurance Program covered 44 U.S. air carriers, with total maximum per occurrence coverage of $68 billion. However, between April 2014 and August 2014, 17 U.S. air carriers switched to commercial coverage, leaving the FAA insuring 27 carriers covering approximately 4% of total RPMs flown by U.S. airlines. The FAA currently insures 27 air carriers, with coverage ranging from $100 million to $3 billion per occurrence. The total maximum exposure of all insurance in force is $31 billion, a 55% reduction from January 2014. Premium collections for FY2014 were estimated at $125 million, and for FY2015, it is estimated at $18 million assuming the program is extended. Coverage includes hull insurance, liability insurance, and third-party war risk liability with no deductibles or coinsurance. The FAA's insurance coverage includes hull insurance, comprehensive liability insurance, and third-party war risk liability. The term \"war risk occurrence\" encompasses various risks such as war, invasion, acts of foreign enemies, civil war, rebellion, strikes, riots, terrorism, malicious acts, and confiscation. Payments for ransom or extortion demands are not covered under this policy. The policy does not cover malicious acts, sabotage, confiscation by foreign governments, hijacking, weapon detonation on the aircraft, or unlawful seizure of the aircraft or crew. Premiums charged by the FAA are based on the risk assumed, with a limit of no more than twice the premium. The FAA Premium War Risk Insurance Program, governed by 49 U.S.C. \u00a744306, bases premiums on risk assumed, limited to no more than twice the premium paid to the Department of Transportation. The program has a small administrative staff and has paid over $10 million for claims since 9/11, including incidents like the attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in 2009. In FY2010, claims totaling $205,600 were filed with the FAA for the bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253. In July 2012, an unattended SkyWest aircraft was seized by a fugitive airline employee who caused damage to airport facilities and vehicles before taking his own life. Claims paid for this incident amount to $9.6 million. Additionally, in April 2014, the FAA paid $256,890 in claims for damage to an insured Boeing 767-223 aircraft caused by gunfire over Afghanistan in 2012. The Secretary of Transportation proposed legislative reforms to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program on March 31, 2014. The FAA is proposing changes to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, including providing war risk coverage for airline losses involving NBCR weapons, full aviation war risk coverage in case of widespread cancellation by private insurers, and non-premium war risk insurance for carriers under Department of Defense contracts. This proposal follows previous attempts to collaborate with commercial insurers for shared-risk coverage. The FAA proposed changes to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, aiming for commercial insurers to take on 20% of the war risk market annually until FY2018. This would reduce FAA's share to 20% by FY2018. The airline industry opposed the changes, arguing they would be costly and result in inadequate insurance protection. Airlines for America recommended maintaining the program as is and extending it for three years. A4A opposed FAA's proposed changes to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, citing concerns about cost and inadequate insurance protection. A4A recommended maintaining the program as is and extending it for three years. The Secretary of Transportation's March 2014 proposal to extend the program was criticized for its budgetary impact, suggesting alternative approaches to reduce costs such as increasing premiums or reducing assumed risk. The Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, with premiums totaling $165 million in FY2013, could potentially increase premiums by raising the statutory cap to reduce implicit subsidies. Insurers invest premiums in U.S. Treasury securities, with returns near historical levels. The Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, currently over $2 billion, is invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Private insurers invest in a wider range of instruments with higher returns. Private insurers' investments are riskier but offer higher returns compared to Treasury securities. Private insurance policies involve risk-sharing mechanisms like deductibles and coverage limits. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program offers coverage with no deductibles or co-insurance, covering losses up to maximum limits. Risk-sharing mechanisms like deductibles and co-insurance discourage behavior that may increase the likelihood of loss, known as \"moral hazard.\" Placing more risk on airlines could lead to significant budgetary savings, as seen in other insurance contexts. Private insurers often share risks among multiple insurers for very large risks. Private insurers often share risks among two or more insurers for very large risks through reinsurance or other loss-sharing arrangements. These contracts can be tailored to achieve the desired form of risk sharing, with each party drawing on their expertise to effectively manage the shared risk. Loss sharing can occur as a percentage of the loss or at a certain level, allowing insurers to leverage their strengths in different facets of insurance operations. Loss-sharing arrangements among insurers can help mitigate risks by combining expertise and financial capital. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act established a program with loss sharing based on the level of loss and a percentage of the loss. Initially, the government covered 85% of losses once they reached 20% of an insurer's premiums, but the program has since been reauthorized with a gradual decrease in government coverage. Improved international guidance on risk decisions for flights in conflict zones is crucial. Improved international guidance for making informed risk decisions regarding flights in conflict zones could stabilize private market war risk insurance premiums and coverage terms. Following the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 over Ukraine in 2014, there is increased interest in disseminating threat information for civilian flight operations in high-risk regions. Insurance providers are now requiring more details on flight routes and considering withdrawing coverage for flights in certain conflict zones in the Middle East and Africa. Airlines are criticized for inconsistent risk assessments, with many flying over conflict zones to save costs unless restricted. In August 2014, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) convened a task force to assess conflict zone risks to civilian aircraft. Countries do not always share information or take adequate precautions to mitigate risks, as restricting flights could impact travel and tourism. Aviation authorities like FAA may need to improve collaboration to ensure safer flight operations. In July 2014, FAA issued restrictions on flights to and from Israel during an armed conflict, prompting international air carriers to suspend service. This highlights the reluctance of governments to disseminate warnings that may impact travel and tourism, despite varying views on risk among regulators, airlines, and insurers. Improved processes for assessing conflict zone hazards to civil aviation, issuing warnings, and restricting flights could address concerns over private market war risk insurance premiums and coverage by potentially reducing uncertainties and ambiguities in assessing risk. EU Regulation 785/2004 requires all air carriers and aircraft operators to be insured for aviation-specific liability, including acts of war, terrorism, hijacking, sabotage, unlawful seizure of aircraft, and civil commotion. The minimum insurance coverage for passenger liability is 250,000 SDRs ($378,523) per passenger, higher than the Montreal Convention's requirement of 113,100 SDRs ($171,259) per passenger. The EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates insurance coverage for aviation-specific liability, including acts of war, terrorism, hijacking, and sabotage. The minimum insurance for passenger liability is $378,523 per passenger, exceeding the Montreal Convention's requirement. For non-commercial aircraft with a MTOM of 2,700 kg, the minimum insurance is $151,409 per passenger. Baggage liability requires $1,712 per passenger, while cargo liability needs $29 per kilogram. Third-party liability insurance ranges from $1,135,568 to nearly $1.06 billion per accident, depending on the aircraft's MTOM. Sanctions for non-compliance are effective, proportional, and dissuasive. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program were created in response to the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, similar to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, provided federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks under certain circumstances. Insurers had started excluding terrorism coverage, making it expensive and scarce in the commercial insurance market. The original TRIA act authorized a three-year program until the end of 2005. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) provided federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks under certain circumstances. Initially authorized for three years until 2005, it was extended multiple times due to the insurance industry's reluctance to cover terrorism risk. TRIA does not directly provide coverage to businesses at risk but offers government reinsurance to private insurers for specific commercial property/casualty lines. The insurance industry supports extending the TRIA program. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) requires insurers to offer terrorism coverage for commercial property/casualty lines. Private insurers cover losses due to terrorism, with the government reimbursing them under certain conditions. There are no upfront premiums for TRIA coverage, but a post-event recoupment fee may be applied. TRIA coverage is limited and operates through private insurers, with similar limits and deductibles as private insurance policies. Losses covered by TRIA are paid from the government's general fund. The private insurance policy for TRIA coverage requires insurers to meet a substantial general deductible. TRIA coverage applies only after $100 million in insured losses from a terrorist act. Private insurers must offer terrorism coverage under the same terms as other causes of loss, but can charge a separate premium. Terrorism premiums may be limited by state laws regulating insurance."
