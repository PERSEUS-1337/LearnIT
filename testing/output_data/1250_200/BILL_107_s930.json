    "content": "The Grand Canyon Capital Improvements Act of 2001 establishes definitions for terms used in the Act, such as fundraising organization, memorandum of agreement, Park (referring to Grand Canyon National Park), and Secretary (referring to the Secretary of the Interior). It also outlines the creation of a fundraising organization and the terms of a memorandum of agreement to support capital improvements in the Park. The Secretary can enter into a memorandum of agreement with a fundraising organization to issue taxable bonds for the Park, subject to professional standards and audits. The United States is not liable for the security of the bonds. The fundraising organization must enter into a memorandum of agreement detailing the bond issue amount, bond maturity not exceeding 20 years, per capita amount for bond repayment and administration costs, project funding details, and agreement modification procedures. The Secretary may authorize the Superintendent of the Park to charge a surcharge of up to $2 per individual in addition to entrance fees collected under various programs. Title VI of the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 allows for a surcharge of up to $2 per individual in addition to entrance fees. The surcharge must be used to amortize bond issues, cover administration costs, and maintain a reserve as determined by the bond underwriter. SEC. 6. USE OF BOND PROCEEDS.\n\nBond proceeds can be used for projects in the Park, subject to certain limitations and prohibitions on administrative expenses. Interest earned on bond proceeds can be used for reserve requirements and reasonable administrative expenses.\n\nSEC. 7. REPORT.
