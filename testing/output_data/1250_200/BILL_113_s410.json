The \"Wall Street Trading and Speculators Tax Act\" imposes a 0.03 percent tax on covered transactions involving securities. The specified base amount for the tax is the fair market value of the security at the time of the transaction. Covered transactions include purchases on U.S. facilities or involving U.S. persons. The \"Wall Street Trading and Speculators Tax Act\" imposes a 0.03 percent tax on covered transactions involving securities traded on U.S. facilities or involving U.S. persons. The term 'security' includes shares of stock, partnership interests, notes, bonds, and derivative financial instruments related to securities. The term 'derivative financial instrument' includes options, forward contracts, futures contracts, or similar financial instruments. A 'notional principal contract' refers to a financial instrument with payments at specified intervals based on a specified index. The term 'specified index' in derivative financial instruments can be a fixed rate, variable rate, index based on objective information, or as prescribed by the Secretary. Exchanges are treated as the sale and purchase of property, including deemed exchanges for stock distributions. The tax implications for certain distributions by corporations are outlined in section 302 or 331. Exceptions include no tax on initial security issuances, short-term indebtedness traded in the US, and securities lending arrangements. The tax imposed by this section is paid by the specified parties. The tax imposed by section 1058 is paid by specific parties based on the type of transaction. If a transaction occurs or is cleared on a US facility, the facility pays the tax. If a purchase is executed by a US broker, the broker pays the tax. For transactions not covered by these scenarios, the tax is paid by the purchaser if they are a US person, or by the seller if the purchaser is not a US person. Payments with respect to certain securities are treated as separate transactions. This includes net initial, final, or periodical payments for notional principal contracts, payments for forward contracts, and premiums for options. The rules also apply to transactions by controlled foreign corporations. For transactions by controlled foreign corporations, they are treated as United States persons. Special rules apply for tax payment on certain transactions, where United States shareholders pay the tax instead of the foreign corporation based on their ownership proportion.

The new section allows a credit to offset transaction tax on certain tax-favored accounts. A credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year is allowed for 0.03 percent of the taxpayer's qualified tax-favored account contributions. Qualified contributions include amounts to retirement plans, Archer MSAs, health savings accounts, and qualified tuition programs. The taxpayer can deduct contributions to qualified tuition programs and Coverdell education savings accounts. Section 1324(b)(2) of title 31, United States Code is amended to include the deduction. The amendment introduces a new tax on trading transactions, effective after December 31, 2013. Reporting requirements for controlled foreign corporations are also updated."
