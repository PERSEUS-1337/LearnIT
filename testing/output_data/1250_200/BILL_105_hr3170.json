SEC. 1260 addresses gains from constructive ownership transactions in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It states that if a taxpayer has gain from such a transaction that would be treated as long-term capital gain, it will be treated as short-term capital gain to the extent that it exceeds the net underlying long-term capital gain. Additionally, there will be an interest charge on deferral of gain recognition if gain is treated as short-term capital gain. The taxpayer's tax for a taxable year may be increased by interest under section 6601 for periods ending on the due date for the return of tax and on underpayments of tax for prior years. Any amount payable is considered in computing deductions for interest. No credits can be used against the tax increase.

No credits can be used against the tax increase. Constructive ownership transaction occurs if the taxpayer holds a long position under a notional principal contract or enters into a forward or futures contract for the same property. This section outlines exceptions for certain transactions that have substantially the same effect as the ones described. The term 'long position' under a notional principal contract involves the right to receive investment yield and the obligation to reimburse any decline in value. A 'forward contract' is defined by section 1259(d)(1), and a 'related person' by section 1259(c)(4). 'Net underlying long-term capital gain' in constructive ownership transactions refers to the aggregate net capital gain if the position had been acquired on the acquisition date. The term 'capital gain' refers to the net gain if a position was acquired and sold on specific dates, with only gains and losses from deemed ownership considered. The net underlying long-term capital gain must be proven with clear evidence. An exception applies if Mark to Market is elected, where gains or losses are recognized as if the financial position was sold at fair market value on the last business day of the taxable year. Any gain or loss from a constructive ownership transaction is treated as ordinary income or loss. If a gain or loss is recognized before the end of the taxable year and would have applied if the transaction was open at year-end, it is considered ordinary income. Adjustments are made for subsequent gains or losses. Any gain or loss from a constructive ownership transaction is treated as ordinary income or loss. An election can be made without the Secretary's consent and applies to the current and future taxable years unless revoked. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations for this section. The amendments made by this section apply to gain recognized after the date of the enactment of this Act."
