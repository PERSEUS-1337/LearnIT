    "content": "During the Vietnam War, Operation Ranch Hand sprayed millions of gallons of herbicides, including Agent Orange, over southern Vietnam. The herbicides contained TCDD, a toxic carcinogen. Dioxin \"hot spots\" have been identified in areas like Bien Hoa, Danang, and the A Luoi Valley. The environmental damage and health issues caused by Agent Orange have prompted a response from the U.S. The former U.S. military base in the A Luoi Valley is a \"hot spot\" for environmental damage caused by Agent Orange. The U.S. has been helping Vietnam address the legacy of war by removing unexploded landmines, bombs, and dioxin contamination. President Obama and President Tran Dai Quang discussed cooperation in cleaning up dioxin at Danang Airport and Bien Hoa Air Base. The Trump Administration has continued to provide assistance to Vietnam for these efforts. Vietnam and the US continue to collaborate on cleaning up dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa Air Base. The Trump Administration has upheld the commitment to assist Vietnam in addressing the Agent Orange issue. Progress has been made at Da Nang Airport, with plans for continued collaboration at Bien Hoa Airport. A Memorandum of Intent was signed in 2018 to begin the dioxin decontamination process. Congress has allocated $254.8 million for environmental remediation and health programs in affected areas of Vietnam. Congress has appropriated $254.8 million for environmental remediation of Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam. Funds are allocated separately for remediation and health programs, with more for the former. The actual amount available may be less due to provisions in the Foreign Assistance Act. The 115th Congress authorized the transfer of $15 million for the Bien Hoa dioxin cleanup. In FY2019, Congress allocated $254.8 million for environmental remediation of Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam, with funds designated for Bien Hoa cleanup. The State Department delegated fund administration to USAID, focusing on Danang airport cleanup and disability support programs in Vietnam. Joint dioxin removal operations are planned for Bien Hoa airbase. The cleanup of Danang airport has been completed, and joint dioxin removal operations at Bien Hoa airbase are planned by U.S. and Vietnamese officials. Discussions are ongoing regarding addressing health issues among Vietnamese nationals due to dioxin exposure. The State Department and USAID are administering programs funded by allocated funds, in cooperation with various Vietnamese ministries and agencies. Vietnam's central government established Office 33 to oversee policies on Agent Orange and dioxin, with representatives from multiple ministries. Congressional interest has focused on allocating funds for environmental remediation of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam and overseeing the State Department and USAID's use of funds for health and disability programs related to Agent Orange/dioxin. The appropriation of funds for this issue began in May 2007 with the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007. The 111th Congress appropriated a total of $18 million for dioxin cleanup in Vietnam and related health services. This included $3 million in the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009, and $3 million in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010. Additionally, $12 million was allocated in July 2010 for the remediation of dioxin contamination at the Danang Airport. In July 2010, Congress allocated $12 million for dioxin contamination remediation at Danang Airport in Vietnam. The State Department and USAID also provided $1.9 million for environmental remediation at the airport in FY2010. The 113th Congress continued to appropriate funds for Agent Orange/dioxin cleanup and related health services in Vietnam. The 113th Congress allocated funds for environmental remediation of Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam and related health services. Appropriations were renewed for FY2013 and FY2014, with $22.0 million for remediation and $7.0 million for health and disability programs. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 also provided funds for dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and health/disability activities in affected areas. Funds allocated for health/disability activities in areas contaminated with Agent Orange or dioxin in Vietnam. $7.5 million for health programs and $15.0 million for environmental remediation. Previous appropriations included $22.0 million for remediation and $7.0 million for health/disability programs. $7 million allocated for health/disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange or dioxin contamination in Vietnam. The funds are intended to address the needs of individuals with severe mobility impairments and cognitive disabilities. The Committee aims for Vietnamese organizations to implement the funds to minimize administrative costs and maximize impact. Funding for FY2017 was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. Additionally, $20 million is designated for dioxin remediation activities, and $10 million for health and disability programs under the Development Assistance heading. The Act appropriates funds for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination in Vietnam, with a specific allocation of $10 million. This marks the first time the US has provided assistance to the Government of Vietnam for dioxin environmental remediation. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated funds for health and disability programs in Vietnam affected by Agent Orange and dioxin contamination, with specific amounts earmarked for remediation efforts and assistance to individuals with disabilities. USAID has been designated as the responsible agency for managing the funds. USAID has obligated appropriated funds for Agent Orange/dioxin-related activities in Vietnam from FY2007 to FY2017. As of May 2018, 81% of $127 million for environmental remediation projects and 63.5% of $44.3 million for health- and disability-related services have been obligated. Congress has raised concerns about the pace and types of programs funded for health and disability activities. Since FY2007, USAID has allocated funds for Agent Orange/dioxin-related activities in Vietnam. Congress has designated health and disability services to be provided near contaminated areas, with specific funding allocations for environmental remediation projects. However, it is unclear if all funds have been obligated according to this guidance. Since FY2007, USAID has allocated funds for health and disability services in Vietnam near Agent Orange/dioxin \"hot spots.\" Funds were initially obligated to programs in Danang, but from FY2010 to FY2013, funds were largely directed to a disability support program by Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI). After consultations, USAID returned to directly obligating funds for health- and disability-related services in smaller amounts from FY2014 onwards, increasing outreach to Vietnamese NGOs. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport funded by congressional appropriations related to Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam experienced delays, increased material for decontamination, and rising costs. The project, initially intended to be completed by October 2013, was finished in August 2017, with costs escalating from $33.7 million to over $110 million. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport saw costs rise from $33.7 million to over $110 million. Soil samples showed high levels of TCDD toxic equivalents, exceeding international standards. Work began in December 2009 with a memorandum of understanding between the State Department and Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources. USAID and Office 33 were designated as implementing agencies for the project. In June 2010, USAID completed an Environmental Assessment of Danang airport recommending thermal desorption for decontamination. The project aimed to remediate 61,700 m3 of contaminated material in six hotspots, costing $33.7 million with potential challenges increasing costs by 50%. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a Memorandum of Intent in December 2010 to start the project in 2011 and complete it by October 2013. The Prime Minister approved the remediation in February 2011, and USAID awarded contracts in July 2012 to CDM Smith for the environmental remediation project. In July 2012, USAID awarded contracts to CDM Smith and Tetra Tech, Inc. for the environmental remediation of Danang airport. CDM Smith received $8.37 million for project oversight and construction management, while Tetra Tech, Inc. was granted $17 million for excavation and construction. On August 9, 2012, a ceremony was held to launch the project at Danang airport, with onsite work starting on August 20, 2012. An internal USAID audit in November 2014 revealed six contracts awarded for the project, including thermal desorption of contaminated soil done in two phases. The decontamination of Danang airport involved treating approximately 45,000 m3 of soil in two phases. Phase 1 started in April 2014 and was completed in April 2015, while Phase 2 began in January 2015 and finished in August 2017. Progress was delayed due to weather conditions, additional soil testing, and facility shutdowns. The Danang Airport facility was shut down in July 2014 to change the filtering system and raise the soil temperature to 335\u00b0C. An internal audit by USAID's Office of Inspector General in November 2014 highlighted risks such as inclement weather and soil cooling delays. The audit recommended implementing a formal risk management plan, more training for Vietnamese officials, and better data documentation procedures by CDM. The project was completed on November 7, 2018, taking longer and costing more than initially planned. The completion of the Danang Airport environmental remediation project took longer and cost more than initially projected by USAID due to underestimating contamination. USAID has provided over $60 million in assistance to disabled Vietnamese, regardless of the cause of disability, starting in 1989. The U.S. government, through the Leahy War Victims Fund, has provided over $60 million in assistance to disabled Vietnamese, including health services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated sites. Programs funded by the State Department and USAID aimed to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities in Danang. A three-year nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program (PDSP) was approved in 2012 to build on previous accomplishments. The PDSP program, funded by USAID, aimed to provide assistance to persons with disabilities in Danang and other high-need areas in Vietnam. The program included grants for health services, rehabilitation therapy, vocational training, and community awareness. Additionally, USAID supported VNAH in addressing disability policy and legal framework needs in Vietnam. The program initially operated in Binh Dinh, Danang, and Dong Nai provinces, focusing on dioxin \"hot spots\" in Phu Cat, Danang, and Bien Hoa. The PDSP program, funded by USAID, extended to provinces beyond the initial areas of Binh Dinh, Danang, and Dong Nai, including Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, and Thua Thien-Hue. USAID aims to provide assistance to persons with disabilities in Vietnam to improve health, independence, and participation in economic and social life. USAID will finance therapies for persons with disabilities in high-prevalence, poverty areas like Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue. They will also administer environmental cleanups at Danang airport and explore cleanup at Bien Hoa airbase, heavily sprayed during the war. The Bien Hoa airbase was heavily sprayed with Agent Orange during the war, leading to significant dioxin contamination. Mitigation measures have been taken, including the construction of a passive landfill for contaminated soil. However, other dioxin \"hot spots\" remain unaddressed, spreading contamination into nearby water bodies. The UNDP has been working with local authorities to map out the extent of dioxin contamination at the airbase. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been working with Office 33 and MONRE for five years to map out the dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa airbase and develop a master plan for dioxin remediation. An estimated 408,500 to 495,300 m3 of contaminated soils and sediments are located on or nearby the airbase, with five different treatment methods considered, ranging in cost from $137 million to $794 million. The estimated costs for dioxin remediation at Bien Hoa airbase range from $137 million to $794 million, with potential variations of 40% less to 75% more. Over $3.7 million has been allocated for environmental assessment, and construction work with a budget of $11.8 million has begun for decontamination efforts. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence have signed a memorandum to start the decontamination process. The MOI signing ceremony between the United States and the Ministry of National Defence commits to a remediation program for Bien Hoa airport. A $183 million aid agreement was signed for decontamination efforts, projected to take 10 years at an estimated cost of $390 million. A memorandum of understanding was signed with a Japanese contractor to construct a decontamination factory using a new technique expected to be more cost-effective. The new technique for decontaminating soil at Bien Hoa airport is expected to cost half as much as previous methods. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited the site and expressed America's commitment to remediate past damage. Congressional interest in addressing Agent Orange/dioxin contamination in Vietnam focuses on providing assistance for environmental remediation and oversight of aid utilization. The Trump Administration has shown support for environmental remediation projects related to Agent Orange and dioxin in Vietnam. The State Department regularly requests funding for decontamination of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam from Congress. Funds have been allocated for health and disability services in areas affected by Agent Orange and dioxin. President Obama's budget requests did not specifically include funding for these programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 continues to allocate funds for health and disability assistance programs. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 designates funds for health and disability services in areas contaminated with Agent Orange/dioxin. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 aims to provide assistance for individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange, including medical care, vocational training, and equipment. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 aims to provide assistance to Vietnamese residents affected by exposure to Agent Orange, including medical care, vocational training, and equipment. The Act also requires support for research on health issues related to Agent Orange, repair of substandard homes, and remediation of contaminated areas in Vietnam. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 focuses on providing assistance to Vietnamese residents affected by exposure to Agent Orange. It prioritizes heavily sprayed areas and military bases for environmental remediation and health services. The Act also mandates quarterly reports to Congress on implementation progress by relevant Secretaries. Congressional oversight includes monitoring funding for cleanup efforts at Danang airport and potential implications for Bien Hoa cleanup. Congressional oversight has focused on the rising cost of cleanup at Danang airport and implications for funding Bien Hoa cleanup. USAID's provision of health services is also scrutinized for slow fund obligation. Danang airport's remediation cost rose from $33.7 million in 2010 to $116 million, leading to concerns about potential cost overruns at Bien Hoa airport. Despite challenges, USAID managed to keep the Danang project going, but struggled to utilize funds for health services in contaminated areas. USAID has been successful in utilizing funds for health services in areas contaminated with Agent Orange/dioxin, with 63.5% of funds from FY2011 to FY2017 being obligated. There have been shifts in USAID's approach to administering these funds, leading to questions about their effectiveness and alignment with congressional priorities. Congressional dissatisfaction with State Department and USAID management of funds is reflected in legislation, with specific amounts usually stipulated in accompanying reports or statements. The precise amounts appropriated are usually stipulated in accompanying reports or explanatory statements. The table below shows the relevant text in the public law and associated language in the reports."
