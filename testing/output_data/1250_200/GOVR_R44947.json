    "content": "The Judiciary Act of 1789 created federal courts under Article III of the Constitution, including the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) to provide remedies for international law violations. The ATS has been modified over the years, with the current version enacted in 1948. Its purpose is to promote harmony in international relations by allowing foreign plaintiffs to seek redress in US courts. States faced challenges in meeting foreign affairs obligations under the Articles of Confederation. The Confederation Congress recommended states create tribunals for international law violations, but only Connecticut passed legislation. The Framers and First Congress granted federal courts jurisdiction to address violations, recognizing the US's duty under international law. The ATS was included among jurisdictional provisions to provide federal courts a forum for claims of international law violations impacting U.S. foreign relations. In the 1780s, incidents involving foreign diplomats highlighted the need for a national judiciary to address conflicts in international relations under the Articles of Confederation. The chief French diplomat in the United States protested to the Confederation Congress after a French citizen, Longchamps, escaped custody in Pennsylvania. Longchamps was later recaptured, convicted, and sentenced to jail, but Pennsylvania officials refused to hand him over to French authorities. The Confederation Congress apologized for its limited ability to provide redress at the federal level. Similar tensions arose when a New York constable arrested a domestic servant of the Dutch Ambassador, who protested that diplomatic immunity should have been granted. U.S. Secretary of Foreign Affairs John Jay reported to Congress that the federal government lacked judicial powers to adjudicate such matters. The federal government lacked judicial powers to adjudicate incidents involving foreign officials injured in the United States, leading to tensions with foreign diplomats. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was interpreted as a response to this issue, although it was rarely used for jurisdiction in its first 190 years. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was rarely used for jurisdiction in its first 190 years. Between 1789 and 1980, litigants successfully invoked the ATS in only two reported decisions. The statute was described as \"an old but little used section\" until the landmark decision in Fil\u00e1rtiga v. Pe\u00f1a-Irala in 1980, where two Paraguayan citizens brought suit against a former Inspector General for alleged kidnapping and torture. In Fil\u00e1rtiga v. Pe\u00f1a-Irala, Paraguayan citizens sued a former Inspector General for kidnapping, torturing, and killing a relative. The defendant, living in New York, was accused of violating international human rights law. The Second Circuit ruled that torture by a state official against its own citizen violates established norms of international law, allowing the case to proceed under the Alien Tort Statute. The Fil\u00e1rtiga court's decision on the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) led to a surge in civil claims for human rights violations in U.S. federal courts. However, subsequent cases like Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic raised questions about the limits of ATS jurisdiction and whether it solely provides jurisdiction or also creates a cause of action for plaintiffs. In Tel-Oren, a group of Israeli citizens and survivors of a terrorist attack in Israel brought an ATS claim against the Palestinian Liberation Organization. The D.C. Circuit unanimously dismissed the case, with different judges offering varying opinions on whether the ATS creates a cause of action for damages. Judge Bork argued that the ATS is purely jurisdictional and does not create a cause of action, while Judge Edwards believed the ATS itself creates a statutory cause of action. Judge Edwards disagreed with Judge Bork on the cause-of-action question in Tel-Oren, arguing that the ATS itself creates a statutory cause of action. However, Judge Edwards still concurred in the case's dismissal due to lack of official state action and insufficient recognition of terrorism as a violation of international law. Judge Robb found the case raised nonjusticiable political questions. The disagreement between Judge Bork and Judge Edwards on the cause-of-action question later became the subject of the landmark Supreme Court decision, Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain. Congress later created the Torture Victim Protection Act, providing a new statutory basis for civil claims for torture and extrajudicial killing. The Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) was signed into law by George H. W. Bush, creating a civil cause of action for damages against individuals who subject others to torture or extrajudicial killing under foreign authority. The TVPA differs from the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) as it allows actions to be brought by and against individuals, not just aliens, but excludes liability for corporations. It establishes a clear basis for causes of action and responds to the need for a separate grant of a private right of action for tort claims under international law. The Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) extends a cause of action to U.S. and foreign nationals, excluding liability against corporations. It requires plaintiffs to exhaust all remedies where the claim occurred. The relationship between TVPA and ATS is unclear, with some courts viewing TVPA as supplementing the ATS. The TVPA provides an express cause of action for claims previously argued under the ATS. The Supreme Court addressed the cause-of-action question in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, involving a Mexican doctor accused of participating in the torture and murder of a DEA agent. The Court rejected arguments to dismiss the criminal case against him. In Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, the Supreme Court clarified that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) provides federal courts with jurisdiction but does not create new causes of action. The ATS was originally enacted as part of the Judiciary Act and is written in jurisdictional language. The Sosa Court clarified that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) provides federal courts with jurisdiction but does not create new causes of action. It held that federal courts could recognize a \"narrow set\" of causes of action as a form of judicially developed common law under the ATS. The Sosa Court clarified that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) allows federal courts to recognize a limited set of tort claims for violations of modern customary international law. However, the claims must be based on norms accepted by the civilized world and defined with specificity comparable to 18th-century paradigms of international law. The Court emphasized the need for judicial caution and restraint in identifying new causes of action under the ATS. In a specific case, the Court found that a claim for arbitrary arrest and detention did not meet the criteria of modern-day international law. The Court dismissed Alvarez's claim for arbitrary arrest and detention under the ATS, stating it did not meet modern international law requirements. Following Sosa, a two-step framework was established for ATS liability, emphasizing the need for specific, universal, and obligatory norms. Despite warnings of judicial caution, the use of ATS for human rights abuses continued until restrictions were recognized in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum in 2013. In Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, the Supreme Court recognized restrictions on the territorial reach of the Alien Tort Statute (ATS). The case involved Nigerian nationals suing oil companies for human rights abuses in Nigeria. The Court ruled that the ATS does not apply to conduct occurring solely in a foreign nation. The Supreme Court applied the \"presumption against extraterritorial application\" to the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), concluding that it does not reach conduct solely in a foreign nation. This presumption aims to prevent clashes between U.S. and foreign law and reflects Congress's focus on domestic concerns. Federal courts presume statutes do not apply extraterritorially unless clearly indicated. The ATS was not intended to have extraterritorial reach, as shown by its history. The Court held that the presumption against extraterritoriality applies to the ATS. The Supreme Court applied the presumption against extraterritorial application to the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), barring Nigerian plaintiffs' claims for violations of the law of nations in Nigerian territory. The Court suggested that future ATS cases must \"touch and concern\" the United States to displace the presumption, requiring a more specific statute if Congress determines otherwise. The Court did not provide further explanation on how an ATS claim could satisfy the \"touch and concern\" test, leading to divergent interpretations in lower courts. The Supreme Court's decision on the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) led to divergent interpretations in lower courts regarding how a claim could satisfy the \"touch and concern\" test. Justices Kennedy, Alito, and Breyer provided differing opinions on the matter, with Justice Alito proposing a broader standard for satisfying the requirement. Justice Breyer, along with Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, concurred with the majority's decision to dismiss the case but disagreed with its reasoning. He argued that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) should not have a presumption of extraterritoriality and proposed a more limited jurisdiction based on specific factors. This included cases where the tort occurs on American soil, the defendant is an American national, or the defendant's conduct significantly impacts an important American national interest. Justice Breyer emphasized the need for the United States to not become a safe harbor for violators of international norms. In applying his proposed test to the Kiobel case, he agreed that the matter should be dismissed. Justice Breyer, in agreement with the majority's decision to dismiss the case, proposed a more limited jurisdiction for the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) based on specific factors to prevent the U.S. from becoming a safe harbor for violators of international norms. The Supreme Court's decision in Kiobel has significantly limited the ATS as a vehicle to address human rights abuses in U.S. courts, particularly in cases where there is no connection to the United States. The interpretation of Kiobel varies among lower courts, creating a split among the circuits on what level of domestic conduct or contact is necessary to satisfy the \"touch and concern\" test. The interpretation of Kiobel varies among lower courts, creating a split among the circuits on what level of domestic conduct or contact is necessary to satisfy the \"touch and concern\" test. The Fifth and Second Circuits require the conduct violating the law of nations to have occurred in the United States, while the Fourth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have a more flexible approach, considering extensive U.S. contacts and a strong connection to the United States. The Eleventh Circuit has held that an ATS claim satisfies the \"touch and concern test\" if it \"has a U.S. focus and adequate relevant conduct occurs in the United States.\" The Ninth Circuit reasoned that a defendant's U.S. citizenship or corporate status is one factor that, in conjunction with other factors, can establish a sufficient connection between an ATS claim and the territory of the United States. The disparity among the circuits arises from their interpretation of Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd. \u2014a pre-Kiobel Supreme Court decision analyzing how the presumption of extraterritoriality applies to Section 10(b). The Ninth and Fourth Circuits have differing conclusions on whether the Morrison \"focus\" analysis applies to ATS cases, which may make it harder for plaintiffs to displace the presumption against extraterritoriality. The Ninth and Fourth Circuits have differing conclusions on whether the Morrison \"focus\" analysis applies to ATS cases. The Fifth and Second Circuits follow Morrison's \"focus\" analysis in interpreting Kiobel, while the Eleventh Circuit adopts a hybrid approach. The Supreme Court's decision in RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community may help resolve this conflict. The Supreme Court's two-step framework for analyzing extraterritoriality issues, as seen in Morrison and Kiobel, includes determining if the statute applies extraterritorially and then assessing if the case involves a domestic application based on the statute's \"focus.\" Lower courts are divided on whether Morrison's \"focus\" analysis applies to ATS cases, with some following the Fifth Circuit's interpretation while others maintain prior Ninth Circuit precedent. RJR Nabisco's impact on lower courts' interpretive frameworks for analyzing extraterritoriality and the ATS remains to be seen. The Ninth Circuit precedent states that Morrison's \"focus\" test does not apply to the ATS. RJR Nabisco may streamline lower courts' frameworks for analyzing extraterritoriality under the ATS. The Supreme Court's decision in Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC is likely to further restrict the use of the statute in pursuing extraterritorial ATS claims, particularly regarding corporate liability. The Supreme Court's decision in Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC addressed the issue of corporate liability under the ATS. The case involved claims by foreign nationals injured by terrorist groups in the Middle East. Arab Bank was accused of aiding and abetting the terrorist organizations. The Supreme Court's decision in Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC addressed allegations that Arab Bank facilitated and financed terrorism by maintaining accounts for terrorist organizations and providing compensation to victims' families. The court dismissed the ATS claims based on the lack of corporate liability, despite a growing consensus among other circuits. The Supreme Court in Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC upheld the Second Circuit's minority approach on corporate liability under the ATS, ruling that foreign corporations are not liable. U.S. corporations may still face claims under the ATS, with Justice Kennedy emphasizing the need for judicial restraint in applying international norms. The Jesner Court upheld the Second Circuit's minority approach on corporate liability under the ATS, stating that foreign corporations are not liable. The decision was based on separation-of-powers and foreign affairs concerns, with the Court emphasizing that Congress is better positioned to consider imposing ATS liability on foreign corporations. The claims against Arab Bank had already caused diplomatic tensions with Jordan, leading the Court to conclude that the political branches, not the Judiciary, should weigh foreign policy concerns. The Jesner Court concluded that foreign corporations may not be defendants in suits under the ATS, citing separation-of-powers principles and the need to avoid diplomatic strife. Justices diverged in their rationale for the holding, with Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito expressing varying views on the matter. Justice Gorsuch also outlined reasons for dismissing the case, emphasizing separation-of-powers principles. Justice Gorsuch provided two fundamental reasons for dismissing Jesner under the ATS: (1) courts should not recognize new causes of action under the ATS due to separation-of-powers principles, and (2) the history of the ATS indicates it was meant for claims against U.S. defendants only. Justice Thomas concurred, agreeing with Justice Kennedy's opinion and Justices Alito and Gorsuch. Justice Sotomayor dissented, arguing that foreign corporations should not be immune from liability under the ATS, suggesting other limitations on jurisdiction instead. The dissent in Jesner argued that foreign corporate liability should not be immune under the ATS, suggesting other limitations on jurisdiction. The debate over the ATS's viability for human rights abuse lawsuits continues, with some believing very few cases will meet the Supreme Court's requirements. However, the ATS still holds significance as suits against U.S. corporations and individual employees of foreign companies are allowed. Several Justices expressed a desire to revisit Sosa's framework. The Supreme Court's holding in Jesner allows for claims against individual employees of foreign companies under the ATS. There is a debate over whether federal courts have discretion to recognize new causes of action for violations of modern international norms. If the Court limits ATS jurisdiction to specific types of claims, such as piracy and violations of safe conducts, it could significantly restrict the statute's scope. Despite its long dormancy, the ATS has become a prominent legal mechanism for human rights and terrorism-related litigation. The Supreme Court's rulings in Sosa, Kiobel, and Jesner have placed significant limitations on the scope of viable ATS claims, potentially signaling the end of the ATS's era of importance. Some believe that further action from Congress is needed to expand ATS jurisdiction beyond its 18th-century roots, shifting the future of ATS litigation to the legislative branch."
