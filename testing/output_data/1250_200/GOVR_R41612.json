President Obama made alleviating global hunger a top priority, leading to the launch of the Feed the Future initiative in 2010 with a $3.5 billion pledge over three years. This initiative aims to promote agricultural development, increase food production, and improve food security and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations. Some argue for reform of American food aid and foreign assistance to address critical issues in global food security. A new U.S. global food security initiative should adopt innovative approaches with local buy-in and private sector engagement for sustainable humanitarian objectives. Interagency reviews of development and foreign assistance policies will inform Congress discussions on the U.S. global food security initiative. The 112th Congress will discuss and fund the U.S. global food security initiative, which involves various U.S. agencies and international organizations. Legislation may be introduced to support agricultural development, international agriculture research, and food security safety net assistance. Congressional influence is exerted through the annual appropriations process and potential authorization bills. The 112th Congress will address the U.S. global food security initiative, considering legislation to support agricultural development and food security. The report highlights the global food insecurity crisis, with over 1 billion people undernourished in 2009 due to food and economic crises. The proportion of hungry people in the world increased in 2008 and 2009 due to global food and economic crises. The estimated number of chronically hungry individuals in 2010 is 925 million, down from 1.023 billion in 2009. FAO data shows a slow but steady increase in undernourished people over the past decade, with gains in hunger reduction reversed in various regions due to declining investment in agriculture. The recent food and economic crises have also impacted the declining trend in hunger reduction. The U.N. Secretary General's Millennium Development Goals report shows that recent food and economic crises have reversed the declining trend in undernourishment. The proportion of hungry people in the world dropped from 20% in the early 1990s to 16% in the mid-2000s, but rose by a percentage point in 2008. Progress in meeting the MDGs of reducing hunger, alleviating poverty, and improving health for the world's poor has slowed or reversed. The majority of undernourished people live in developing countries, with Asia and the Pacific having the highest number of chronically undernourished individuals. The 2010 hunger figure globally declined by 9.6% from 2009, with Asia seeing a reduction of 80 million hungry people. Sub-Saharan Africa had a smaller drop of 12 million, still having the highest rates of food insecurity. The 2010 Global Health Index (GHI) improved from 1990 to 2010, with significant progress in Southeast Asia and Latin America. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa had the highest GHI scores. The Global Health Index (GHI) scores have decreased by 40% or more, with South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa having the highest scores. The causes of hunger differ between the regions, with South Asia facing issues related to women's status and sub-Saharan Africa dealing with government effectiveness and health challenges. Progress in reducing GHI scores has been slower in these regions compared to Latin America. Between 1990 and 2010, many countries saw a reduction in their Global Health Index (GHI) scores, with some achieving a decrease of 50% or more. However, nine countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, experienced an increase in their GHI scores due to factors like conflict, political instability, HIV/AIDS prevalence, and economic collapse. Some countries, such as Angola and Ethiopia, made significant progress in improving their GHI scores during this period. President Obama made global hunger a top priority of his Administration, pledging $3.5 billion over three years for agricultural development and food security at the G8 Summit in 2009. The Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security was launched with a goal of mobilizing $20 billion to combat hunger and poverty. Ghana was among the top performers in improving their Global Health Index score between 1990 and 2010. The G8 summit committed to five principles for a food security initiative, focusing on sustainable production and rural economic growth. They pledged sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity and support country and regional agricultural strategies. The G8 summit committed to sustainable funding for agriculture development assistance, supporting country-led coordination processes in line with the Accra Agenda for Action. Developing countries and donors agreed to take control of their futures through country-led strategies and implementation plans, with a focus on the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) in sub-Saharan Africa. Established in 2003, CAADP aims to improve food security, nutrition, and increase incomes in the region. The CAADP program, part of NEPAD and the AU, focuses on improving food security, nutrition, and increasing incomes of smallholder farmers. It aims to raise agricultural productivity by 6% annually and increase public investment in agriculture to 10% of national budgets. The L'Aqulia declaration aligns with the U.N. High Level Task Force's Comprehensive Framework for Action to address global food security challenges. This includes immediate actions for vulnerable populations and longer-term strategies for global food and nutrition security. The CFA called for short-term measures like boosting smallholder farmer food production and adjusting trade policies, and long-term strategies such as expanding social protection systems and improving international food market accessibility. The G20 Summit endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative and proposed a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund. Additional commitments were made by countries like Belgium, Finland, Norway, and Switzerland. The United States also collaborated with private sector actors on food security efforts. In November 2009, FAO convened a World Summit on Food Security in Rome with 60 heads of state and government endorsing the Global Partnership to reduce hunger by half by 2015. FAO reported the need for a 70% increase in agricultural output to feed a population of over 9 billion by 2050. The U.S. State Department issued a Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative Consultation Document in September 2009, leading to the official launch of the initiative in May 2010. The Administration launched the \"Feed the Future\" Initiative in May 2010, with a strategy guide developed through a consultative process. The initiative focuses on sustainable food security principles and has priorities in gender, environment, and climate change. It aims to accelerate inclusive agriculture sector growth and improve nutritional status in specific countries. The \"Feed the Future\" Initiative aims to accelerate inclusive agriculture sector growth and improve nutritional status in specific countries by focusing on interventions to improve agricultural productivity, expand markets, develop policies, and promote infrastructure. Progress will be measured through changes in agricultural production and income levels of farmers. The initiative also aims to strengthen the links between agriculture and improved nutrition outcomes. Activities and investments will vary by country based on key priorities articulated in each country's strategy. The \"Feed the Future\" Initiative aims to strengthen the links between agriculture and improved nutrition outcomes. It will coordinate closely with host governments, other partners, and the USG's Global Health Initiative to implement a nutrition strategy based on country-specific needs. Progress will be measured through changes in stunted and wasted children, and underweight women. The initiative will also invest in regional programs, strategic partnerships with countries like Brazil, India, and China, and global research and innovation. It does not include traditional U.S. food aid funding but maintains a commitment to providing emergency food assistance. Currently focusing on 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The Feed the Future (FtF) initiative is targeting 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean based on criteria such as chronic hunger, agricultural-led growth potential, and government commitment. Investments will be made in two phases, with Phase 1 focusing on capacity-building and technical assistance for developing country investment plans, while Phase 2 countries should have completed their plans. Phase 2 countries under the Feed the Future initiative must have completed a Country Investment Plan (CIP) that includes priority areas, clear costing, financial projections, defined targets, beneficiary analysis, gender assessment, and a practical implementation plan. They must also commit their own resources and establish a policy environment conducive to agricultural development and improved nutrition. The FY2011 budget request for FtF activities is $1.64 billion, representing about 3% of the total international affairs budget. The FY2011 request for Feed the Future (FtF) activities is $1.64 billion, which is 40% higher than the estimated FY2010 allocation. The increase is mainly due to a $408 million contribution to a new multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. The budget justification notes that $200 million for nutrition activities are funded through the Global Health and Child Survival account, separate from FtF. The FY2010 estimate does not include Haiti-related supplemental appropriations focused on emergency food aid and debt cancellation, not part of the FtF framework. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future (FtF) represents only a portion of foreign assistance requested for food and agriculture activities. Additionally, for FY2011, the Administration is requesting $4.2 billion for humanitarian and emergency assistance, including funding for Food for Peace Title II, Migration and Refugee Assistance, International Disaster Assistance, and Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance. There have been discussions during the 111th Congress about the need to reform U.S. foreign aid programs to better address national security challenges and development needs. Many criticize U.S. aid programs as inefficient, uncoordinated, and not aligned with national security interests or host country needs. The Obama Administration attempted to address issues with U.S. foreign aid programs by launching the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in 2009. Led by the State Department, the QDDR aimed to develop a whole-of-government approach to U.S. development policy. Despite delays, Secretary Clinton released the findings in 2010, outlining a strategy to elevate American \"civilian power\" to better advance national interests and partner with the military. The QDDR, along with the PSD-7, aimed to elevate American \"civilian power\" to advance national interests and partner with the military. It developed a statement of U.S. foreign policy and development objectives, recommended strategies, tools, resources, and organizational reforms needed for implementation. The PSD-7 focused on reviewing the roles of U.S. government agencies in global development to enhance policy effectiveness. The process was led by key officials and NSC staff dealing with development, democracy, and regional issues. The PSD-7 review, led by key officials and NSC staff, prioritizes economic growth and democratic governance in U.S. foreign policy. The process has been delayed, with uncertainty on whether final outputs will be publicly released. President Obama announced a new Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development on September 22, 2010. President Obama's new Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development, announced on September 22, 2010, emphasizes the importance of development, diplomacy, and defense in national security. Global Food Security, Climate Change, and Global Health are key initiatives highlighted in the directive. The establishment of a new Bureau for Food Security (BFS) at USAID in November 2010 will lead efforts to implement the Feed the Future initiative and coordinate interagency efforts with the State Department, Millennium Challenge Corporation, USDA, and others. The BFS will coordinate interagency efforts for the Feed the Future initiative, expanding partnerships with private sector and NGOs. The 112th Congress faces issues on agricultural development, global food security, and U.S. foreign aid reform. Congress is considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development within the initiative, with the House bill proposing $1 billion for food security. In FY2011, Congress provided $52.81 billion for State-Foreign Operations, $4 billion less than requested. The Senate bill allocated $54.22 billion, $1.40 billion less than the House draft. Funding for the federal government was extended through continuing resolutions until March 4, 2011. The current fiscal situation and shift in congressional leadership may lead to further debate on funding priorities related to food security and agricultural development. The G8's commitment to the Global Partnership is doubted, with concerns over meeting aid pledges. Skepticism exists over the leadership at USAID for global development efforts. Development experts have raised concerns about the lack of strong leadership at USAID, the primary U.S. federal agency for global development. The delay in appointing key officials has allowed other federal agencies to take on a larger role in development activities traditionally overseen by USAID. Critics question the divided approach among different agencies and its impact on USAID's authority and resources. The Center for Global Development notes the absence of USAID in significant foreign policy challenges. Several senior government officials, including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former USAID Administrator Peter McPherson, have raised concerns about the severe decline in staff capacity at USAID over the past few decades. Secretary Gates highlighted the imbalance between military and civilian elements of national security, attributing it to a lack of capacity rather than will. This decline in capacity can be traced back to the 1990s when key instruments of U.S. power abroad were reduced, such as the freezing of Foreign Service officer hiring at the State Department and the significant decrease in permanent staff at USAID from 15,000 during the Vietnam War to less than 3,000 today. International Development has seen a significant decrease in staff capacity over the years, with USAID having only 2,000 permanent foreign officers in 1980, which declined to about 1,000 by 2008. Currently, USAID has only two engineers, 16 agriculture experts, and 17 education experts. This reduction in staff has led to the closing of overseas missions and a shift towards contracting out foreign aid programs. Critics argue that this has resulted in less coherence, effectiveness, flexibility, and leverage with other funders. Additionally, there are concerns about country-level fragmentation in USAID-managed agricultural development assistance. Since the 1990s, USAID has faced challenges in managing its agricultural development portfolio due to staff shortages and country-level fragmentation. To address this, USAID has hired additional agriculture foreign-service officers and is working on rebuilding its technical capacity. Land-grant universities have been involved in international development efforts since the 1970s through the Title XII amendment. The role of capacity building at USAID has been declining, with a significant decrease in post-graduate training and support for agricultural research. This has weakened institutional capacity in developing countries, despite USAID acknowledging the importance of long-term institutional building. Questions remain about the sufficient institutional capacity in both the United States and developing countries to effectively implement agricultural programs. Some questions exist about the institutional capacity in the United States and developing countries, particularly Africa, to implement agricultural research and market development programs. Sub-Saharan Africa lacks a strong scientific foundation for modern agriculture, with governments and donors hesitant to invest in science and technology. Various U.S. agencies, including USAID, State Department, USDA, MCC, Treasury Department, and USTR, are involved in agricultural development and food security assistance. Interagency coordination in providing this assistance is a significant challenge. The Chicago Council on Global Affairs highlighted challenges in interagency coordination for foreign assistance, including food aid and nutrition. Recommendations included creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture and a White House National Security Council deputy for global agriculture. The Government Accountability Office also reported on coordination issues between USDA, USAID, and the Millennium Development Corporation. The Feed the Future initiative aims for a \"whole-of-government\" approach to address these challenges. The new food security initiative presents a challenge and opportunity for U.S. efforts to enhance interagency coordination. Some view fragmentation across government agencies as a constraint. USAID is designated as the lead implementation agency for the Feed the Future initiative, but coordination with other U.S. government entities is still unclear. Bills in Congress emphasize the need for interagency coordination to address global hunger. Donors and aid agencies have recognized the need to harmonize strategies and activities to reduce costs on aid recipients. The United States works with partner countries and international bodies to harmonize aid strategies and activities. They coordinate with donors like Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union to make aid more effective. Global summits and organizations like the United Nations and the OECD Development Assistance Committee play a key role in donor coordination and establishing development goals. Aid donors aim to increase predictability and flexibility in aid resources. The United States aligns with other donors to increase aid predictability and flexibility for development. This includes supporting initiatives like the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) and endorsing principles from U.N-sponsored forums. Debates exist on the pace of aid reform and the balance between aligning with other donors and prioritizing U.S. interests in foreign assistance activities. The United States prioritizes foreign assistance activities aligned with its strategic and domestic interests, emphasizing country-led planning for program relevance and sustainability. Concerns exist over donor control and oversight, capacity limitations in developing countries, and potential exclusion of civil society and private sector actors in the planning process. Coordination with U.S. food aid is not explicitly addressed in the Feed the Future Guide. The Feed the Future strategy emphasizes coordination but lacks mention of coordinating U.S. food aid with its activities in focus countries. Food for Peace Title II aid is a significant component of U.S. food security assistance. Questions arise on how U.S. commodity food aid will align with Feed the Future efforts and if food aid will support or hinder FtF objectives. The strategy also highlights cross-cutting initiatives like gender, global health, and climate change, but lacks clarity on their integration into country plans and resource commitments. The Feed the Future initiative is working on a results framework with key indicators to track progress towards its goals. It is unclear which agency will be responsible for monitoring progress and when results will be realized. Questions remain about how Feed the Future will align with other USG initiatives and if it will help achieve MDG1 in the 20 countries involved. Congress is unsure about the frequency of updates on the initiative's progress."
