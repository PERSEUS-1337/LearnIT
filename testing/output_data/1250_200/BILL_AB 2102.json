    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Controller, in consultation with the California Gambling Control Commission, will divide the County Tribal Casino Account into Individual Tribal Casino Accounts for each tribe operating a casino in the county. Funds from these accounts will be used to make grants to local jurisdictions impacted by tribal casinos, based on each tribe's contributions to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund in the prior fiscal year. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee in each county where Indian gaming is conducted is responsible for selecting grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts or County Tribal Casino Accounts. The committee must follow established priorities and requirements, establish application policies, assess eligibility of grant applications from local jurisdictions impacted by tribal gaming operations, and ensure grants mitigate the impact of the casino on the grant applicant. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee assesses grant applications from local jurisdictions impacted by tribal gaming operations and determines reimbursement for county administrative costs. The committee is composed of seven representatives, including two from the county selected by the county board of supervisors. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee consists of seven representatives, including two from the county selected by the county board of supervisors, and three elected representatives from cities near tribal casinos in the county. Additional local representatives may be selected based on mutual agreement between the county board of supervisors and tribes contributing to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. The Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee consists of seven representatives, including two from the county selected by the county board of supervisors, and three elected representatives from cities near tribal casinos in the county. Two representatives are selected based on the recommendation of tribes paying into the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund in each county, or tribes operating casinos in counties where no tribes contribute to the fund. The committee must adopt a Conflict of Interest Code in compliance with legal requirements. Sixty percent of the Individual Tribal Casino Account is allocated for nexus grants to cities and counties impacted by contributing tribes. Grants are determined by a nexus test based on proximity to tribal casinos, with priority given to jurisdictions bordering Indian lands or providing access routes to casinos within four miles. Grants are selected by the Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee and administered by the county. Multiyear grants are also available. The allocation of funds for nexus grants to local government jurisdictions is based on proximity to tribal casinos. Grants are awarded based on criteria such as maintaining access routes to casinos within four miles. Fifty percent of the funds are awarded to jurisdictions meeting all criteria, while thirty percent are awarded to those meeting three criteria. If no eligible jurisdiction meets the requirements, funds are distributed to jurisdictions meeting other criteria. Twenty percent of the funds specified in subdivision (c) will be awarded to local government jurisdictions meeting two nexus test criteria. If no eligible jurisdiction qualifies, the funds will be distributed to jurisdictions meeting other criteria. Additionally, twenty percent of each Individual Tribal Casino Account will be available for discretionary grants to local jurisdictions impacted by tribes paying into the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Grant awards will be selected by each county's Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee and administered by the county on a multiyear basis. Twenty percent of each Individual Tribal Casino Account is allocated for discretionary grants to local jurisdictions impacted by tribes not contributing to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Grants are available irrespective of any specific tribal casino impact and can be awarded for service-oriented impacts or large capital projects related to Indian gaming. The grants are subject to the sponsorship of the contributing tribe and recommendations of the Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee for each county. If an eligible county lacks a tribal casino not contributing to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund, discretionary grants will be distributed according to specific guidelines. Funds from the County Tribal Casino Account can be released for grants to local jurisdictions impacted by tribal casinos, regardless of a specific casino connection. Unallocated funds revert back to the Distribution Fund annually, with a deadline for expenditure set for the fiscal year. Moneys allocated for the 2003\u201304 fiscal year can be spent until December 31, 2004. Grant priorities from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts include law enforcement, fire services, and environmental impacts. Grant applications must mitigate casino impacts on local jurisdictions, or the grant will be terminated. Grants must be used only for the proportionate share of expenditures that mitigate casino impacts. All grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts require tribal sponsorship and must align with casino impact priorities. Grants cannot support anti-Indian gaming efforts and will be terminated if misused. Unused grant funds will be reallocated for qualified nexus grants. Local government jurisdictions receiving grants from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts must publicly acknowledge the funding source. County Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committees approve projects for funding, with unallocated funds reverting back to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund at the end of each fiscal year. Grant moneys have specific expenditure deadlines. The local government must deposit grant funds from Individual Tribal Casino Accounts into an interest-bearing account for mitigating casino impacts. If funds are used for other purposes, the remaining amount goes back to the Indian Gaming Special Distribution Fund. Compliance with spending requirements must be demonstrated to the county to receive further funds. If state-mandated costs are determined, reimbursement to local agencies will be made. The Legislature intends to enact legislation related to tribal gaming in California."
