The Congress recognizes the importance of detection canines in homeland security to detect explosives, narcotics, and concealed humans in various areas. There is a shortage of detection canines available to assist law enforcement despite the authorization of new Border Patrol agents. Detection canines are crucial in homeland security for detecting explosives, narcotics, and concealed humans. Despite the authorization of new Border Patrol agents, there is a shortage of detection canines available to assist law enforcement in various areas. Canines have been deployed to airports, but there is a need to increase capacity for training and deployment in mass transit systems. Urban search and rescue canines were effective during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, while various agencies regularly use detection canines for security purposes. The Committee on Homeland Security discussed the shortage of trained detection canines for homeland security activities during a hearing on September 28, 2005. Various Federal agencies, a local transit police department, a private canine security company, and a university-based training center highlighted the lack of trained canines. In fiscal years 2007 through 2011, the Secretary of Homeland Security must increase the number of trained detection canines by at least 25 percent at ports of entry, airports, mass transit systems, Coast Guard stations, Secret Service operations, Federal Protective Service operations, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. SEC. 4. COORDINATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF CANINE TRAINING PROGRAMS. The Secretary of Homeland Security is required to coordinate canine training programs for various security missions, utilize existing resources efficiently, and explore partnerships to increase the number of trained detection canines available to law enforcement agencies. A report on the Department's plan for coordination and consolidation of canine training is due to relevant congressional committees within 120 days of the enactment of the Act. The Department of Homeland Security is required to submit a report within 120 days on its plan to coordinate and consolidate canine training programs, including increasing coordination with other Federal agencies like the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with increasing the use of domestically bred canines for counter-terrorism efforts, consulting with other agencies to encourage domestic breeding and consolidate procurement to reduce costs."
