    "title": "SB 45",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 89003 of the Government Code prohibits mass mailings within 90 days before an election by or on behalf of a candidate for city, county, or special district office. This new law does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution. The bill aims to further the purposes of the Political Reform Act of 1974 by amending Section 14000 of the Unemployment Insurance Code to emphasize the importance of a well-educated and highly skilled workforce in California's competitiveness. It outlines principles for workforce investment programs to meet the needs of employers, workers, and students by preparing them for the global economy, increasing industry-recognized certifications and degrees, and adapting to changing labor market requirements. State and local workforce investment boards are encouraged to collaborate with various institutions to align resources across workforce education and training systems, aiming to prepare workers for good-paying jobs and adapt to changing labor market requirements. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of adopting local and regional training strategies, building partnerships across education and workforce systems, and ensuring workforce programs are data-driven and industry-involved. It highlights the need for sector strategies, career pathways, and strong private sector partnerships to address skills gaps and meet the needs of job seekers, workers, and employers within regional labor markets. Workforce investment programs should partner with industry employers and unions, consider the needs of businesses of all sizes, be outcome-oriented and accountable, and accessible to individuals with employment barriers. The California Workforce Investment Board and Labor and Workforce Development Agency are defined in the Unemployment Insurance Code. The Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to define key terms related to workforce development, such as the California Workforce Investment Board and Labor and Workforce Development Agency. Terms like career pathways, cluster-based sector strategies, and data-driven decision-making are also clarified. Economic security for workers is defined as earning a wage sufficient to support a family and save for emergencies and retirement. (g) \"Evidence-based\" refers to using policy research to determine best practices, adopting policies with proven positive outcomes across different settings and populations. Successful programs deliver measurable and lasting results, different from traditional or anecdotal approaches.\n(h) \"High-priority occupations\" are in-demand jobs in specific industries that offer economic security.\n(i) \"Individuals with employment barriers\" have characteristics limiting their ability to find work, such as poor work history, lack of experience, or educational skills, disability, or welfare dependency. An industry cluster is a geographic concentration of interdependent industries with common resources and relationships in a regional economy. An industry or sector partnership is a collaborative effort that brings together key stakeholders in a specific industry cluster to address workforce needs. This partnership involves multiple firms, labor groups, education providers, and workforce systems working together to develop strategies for workforce development. Successful sector partnerships analyze labor markets, identify employment barriers, establish skill standards and training programs, and create career advancement opportunities for workers of all skill levels. An industry or sector partnership involves representatives from various stakeholders including employers, labor organizations, educational institutions, workforce agencies, government entities, economic development agencies, chambers of commerce, nonprofit organizations, philanthropic organizations, industry associations, and other relevant organizations as needed. Industry sector partnerships involve economic development organizations, industry associations, and other necessary organizations. An industry sector comprises firms with similar products/services and workforce needs in a regional labor market. Sector strategies prioritize investments in competitive industries based on growth potential and job security through workforce training programs. To boost labor productivity and address workforce supply issues, resources can be directed towards education and training programs for high-demand occupations. These programs may target underserved communities, disconnected youths, incumbent workers, and military veterans. Industry partnerships are often used to implement these strategies at the regional level. The \"Workforce Investment Act of 1998\" is a federal law that defines labor market areas as geographically integrated areas where individuals can find employment without changing their residence. A recognized postsecondary credential includes industry-recognized certificates, licenses, or degrees. A core program is authorized under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The California Workforce Investment Board is responsible for aligning the state's workforce system with the needs of the 21st-century economy. It works in partnership with various agencies to ensure system alignment across federal programs like the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. Additionally, a new article is added to the Unemployment Insurance Code to further enhance workforce development efforts. The Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to include Article 4, which outlines the Regional Planning process in alignment with the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. This involves identifying regions and engaging in a planning process with local boards and officials to enhance workforce development efforts. The Regional Planning process involves the preparation of a regional plan, establishment of service strategies, sector initiatives, labor market data analysis, administrative cost arrangements, coordination of transportation and supportive services, and collaboration with economic development services. It also includes negotiating performance measures with the Governor. The state mandates local boards and officials to prepare a single regional plan incorporating local plans for each area. Technical assistance and labor market data will be provided to aid in planning and service delivery. No reimbursement is required as this act implements federal regulations."
