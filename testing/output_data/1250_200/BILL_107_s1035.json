    "content": "The \"Great Lakes Preservation Act\" may be cited as the official title of this legislation. Congress finds that the Great Lakes are crucial natural resources vital for the economies of the Great Lakes States, providing safe drinking water and supporting various industries. The Great Lakes Charter of 1985 guides decisions on water diversion within the basin. Premiers of the Great Lakes Provinces base decisions on proposals to withdraw, divert, or use Great Lakes water on conserving and protecting water and water-dependent natural resources of the Great Lakes basin. Decision-making concerning Great Lakes water should remain with the Governors of the Great Lakes States. The text chunk \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" is a section that likely provides definitions for terms used in the context of decisions regarding Great Lakes water usage. The \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" section defines key terms related to Great Lakes water usage, including the terms Administrator, bulk fresh water, from the Great Lakes basin, and Great Lake. The \"Great Lake\" refers to Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, Lake Ontario, and Lake Superior. The \"Great Lakes Province\" is Ontario or Quebec, Canada, while the \"Great Lakes State\" includes Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service. SEC. 4. MORATORIUM ON EXPORT OF BULK FRESH WATER. Bulk fresh water from the Great Lakes basin shall not be exported from the United States. The moratorium will end when an approved mechanism for water decisions is in place. Congress suggests a US-Canada agreement to uphold the moratorium. SEC. 5. PRESERVATION OF HISTORIC GREAT LAKES LIGHTHOUSES. Congress finds that the Great Lakes have played a significant role in the history of settlement, commerce, and transportation in the Great Lakes States. Lighthouses in the region have been crucial for guiding mariners and hold historical and architectural importance. However, many lighthouses are in poor condition due to neglect. A study will be conducted by the Secretary to explore options for preserving these lighthouses within 3 years. The Secretary will review National Park Service programs to preserve lighthouses and consult with various historical and preservation entities. Appropriations are authorized for this purpose."
