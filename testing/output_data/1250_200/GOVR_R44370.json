It was established after James Smithson, an English scientist, left his estate to the United States to found the institution. Today, SI is a complex of museums, education, research, and revenue-generating entities primarily located in Washington, DC, with additional facilities across the US and world. It employs 6,500 staff and 6,300 volunteers, with its museums and zoo visited 29.3 million times in FY 2015. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a government establishment overseen by a board composed of representatives from each branch. It manages entities created by Congress and accepts gifts, seeks grants, and raises funds. SI receives an annual appropriation of approximately $696 million but does not execute direct government programs beyond increasing and diffusing knowledge. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) receives an annual appropriation of approximately $696 million, which comprises about 60% of its annual expenditures. It also has separate funding streams from grants, gifts, and commercial activities, known as \"trust funds,\" totaling $484.7 million in FY2016. SI employs federal and nonfederal staff and is overseen by a Board of Regents authorized by Congress. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) operates as a tax-exempt educational organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. It is overseen by a Board of Regents authorized by Congress to carry out various activities and oversee entities. The Regents have broad authority to oversee and amend SI's activities, which are also managed by the secretary and staff. Individual SI entities may have boards of overseers and independent professional leadership. The Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution consists of three Senators, three House Members, and nine citizen Regents. The Chief Justice traditionally serves as chancellor. A three-Regent executive committee is elected, with two citizen Regents as chair and vice-chair. Congressional appointments are renewable, while citizen Regents serve six-year terms. The secretary oversees SI buildings and property and keeps records of the Regents' proceedings. The secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, appointed by the Regents, is responsible for SI buildings, property, and record-keeping. David J. Skorton is the current secretary. The organization is divided into eight areas, including Science, History, Art, Culture, Finance, Administration, Collections, Education, Communications, Advancement, and Smithsonian Enterprises. In 2014, Boris Johnson announced plans for a cultural area in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, with SI authorized to work on an agreement for exhibit space. The Regents of the Smithsonian Institution developed terms for an agreement with the LLDC for exhibit space in a cultural complex, requiring a $50 million funding commitment from the United Kingdom. SI considered the proposal in line with its mission, with plans for a sustainable funding model for a permanent museum. In June 2016, SI and the Victoria and Albert Museum announced an agreement to develop a museum. Horvath stated that a funding model for a permanent SI museum was being considered. In collaboration with the Victoria and Albert Museum, a jointly organized permanent gallery space was announced as part of V&A East. Secretary Skorton emphasized that this collaboration was not just a Smithsonian outpost in London but a way to engage with diverse audiences. SI has initiated programs without congressional authorization in the past, using its own funds before seeking appropriations when programs became permanent. This strategy aligns with SI's mission to increase and diffuse knowledge. The Smithsonian Institution has a history of initiating programs without congressional authorization, using its own funds before seeking appropriations when programs become permanent. This strategy aligns with SI's mission to increase and diffuse knowledge. One potential issue with establishing an SI museum in London is that the rationales and authorities used for domestic facilities may not necessarily apply to international locations. Congress has authorized SI to oversee activities in Panama and Belize with at least after-the-fact approval. The Smithsonian Institution conducts research activities in locations outside of Washington, DC, with the exception of a few museums. These research locations do not have a public display component, unlike museums in the United States. The potential establishment of an SI museum in London raises questions about how it aligns with the institution's mission to increase and diffuse knowledge. The potential establishment of an SI museum in London raises questions about how it aligns with the institution's mission to increase and diffuse knowledge, as well as concerns about funding and congressional approval. The Smithsonian Institution's congressional establishment and domestic concerns in budget requests, including resources for renovation of facilities, have prompted discussions about the establishment of an SI museum in London. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced a bill in 2015 to modernize the Smithsonian by changing the number of Regents and their appointment process. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced H.R. 3169 in 2015 to modernize the Smithsonian by increasing full-time Regents dedicated to oversight and fundraising. The bill aimed to rescue the Smithsonian from its outdated governance structure and allow access to private resources. H.R. 3387, introduced in 2015, sought to make the Smithsonian subject to transparency laws and hold open meetings. H.R. 3169 and H.R. 3387 aimed to modernize the Smithsonian by increasing oversight and fundraising efforts, and making the institution subject to transparency laws and open meetings. S. 2057 and H.R. 3702 proposed funding for additional storage and laboratory space for collections at Smithsonian facilities, but no further action was taken on these bills. On October 7, 2015, Representative Sam Johnson introduced H.R. 3702, a bill related to Smithsonian collections space authorization. It was referred to the Committees on House Administration and Transportation and Infrastructure. On December 18, 2015, Representative Grace Meng introduced H.R. 4307, focusing on establishing a new national museum for Asian Pacific American history and culture within the Smithsonian Institution. The bill H.R. 4307 aimed to establish a National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture within the Smithsonian Institution. It proposed creating a council to advise the Regents on construction and operation of the museum, appointing a museum director, and designating a site for the museum within 12 months of the bill's enactment. On December 12, 2015, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure referred a measure to the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management. On January 4, 2016, the Committee on Natural Resources referred the measure to the Subcommittee on Federal Lands. No further action was taken. Representative Xavier Becerra introduced H.R. 6001 on September 13, 2016, to establish a Smithsonian American Latino Museum in SI's Arts and Industries Building on the National Mall. The bill would have authorized the Regents to plan and construct the museum, including an underground annex facility, in a manner harmonious with the National Mall. H.R. 6001, introduced by Representative Xavier Becerra, aimed to establish a Smithsonian American Latino Museum on the National Mall. The bill was referred to multiple committees for consideration, but no further action was taken. A companion measure, S. 3314, was introduced by Senator Robert Menendez with identical provisions to H.R. 6001, but also did not progress beyond committee referral."
