    "content": "The aiding and abetting subsection of 18 U.S.C. 2 holds individuals accountable for assisting in the commission of federal crimes. It requires the defendant to actively contribute to the success of another's crime by associating themselves with the venture and seeking to make it succeed. This secondary liability is similar to conspiracy, as society fears the crimes of multiple individuals more than those of one. Aiding and abetting involves assisting in someone else's crime by consciously contributing to its success. The defendant must know the offense is happening before it occurs to be convicted. The level of assistance can be minimal, but both knowledge and intent are required. Aiding and abetting is not a federal offense itself but describes how a defendant's actions led to a law violation. In Standefer, the Supreme Court ruled that aiding and abetting requires a completed offense before or at the time of the crime. Assistance given after the crime is a separate offense as an accessory. Sometimes accomplices can avoid federal principles of secondary liability, especially when there is a significant culpability gap between them and the primary offender. This typically involves victims, customers, or subordinates. The accomplice or co-conspirator's culpability can affect their conviction, especially when there is a significant gap between them and the primary offender. Three types of accomplices are victims, customers, and subordinates. Not every victim qualifies for an exception, as seen in cases involving extortion or bribery. Customers like drinkers, bettors, johns, and drug addicts may escape conviction as co-conspirators. Examples from Supreme Court cases show that customers of illegal establishments may not be prosecuted as aiders and abettors. The federal law does not prosecute customers of illegal establishments like gambling dens or drug traffickers as aiders and abettors. The Controlled Substances Act reinforces this view by punishing traffickers severely but customers for simple possession. Subordinates may have more difficulty avoiding secondary liability, but there are exceptions, as seen in the Gebardi case. In Gebardi, the Supreme Court ruled that a woman transported for immoral purposes could not be charged with conspiracy under the Mann Act. Lower courts followed this ruling but limited it to cases where the prostitute only acquiesced to transportation. OSHA's provisions do not allow prosecution of employees of an offender. Subordinates of federal gambling business statute offenders can be prosecuted, but there is no consensus on treatment of subordinates of drug kingpins. The law punishes those who cause an act to be done that would be an offense if directly performed. Section 2(b) of the law applies to defendants who work through intermediaries, whether witting or unwitting, guilty or innocent. The intermediary's awareness of their conduct does not affect liability. The amendment in 1951 changed \"causes\" to \"willfully causes\" without clear purpose. Congress requires that the actions of the defendant and intermediary together constitute an offense for liability to apply. The 1951 amendment to Section 2(b) of the law changed \"causes\" to \"willfully causes\" without a clear purpose. The addition of \"willfully\" was speculated to address a mental element observation by Judge Learned Hand. Courts interpret \"willfully\" as intending the commission of a crime and using someone else to commit it. Liability under Section 2(b) can be incurred even if the individual is unaware that the conduct is a crime. Federal courts mention a withdrawal defense similar to conspiracy cases. In aiding and abetting cases, the withdrawal defense may be more limited compared to conspiracy cases. A defendant must demonstrate affirmative action to withdraw, such as informing authorities or coconspirators. The question of withdrawal from aiding and abetting a crime is unsettled, with varying results in different courts. Proponents of a general withdrawal defense may find support in recent dicta in Rosemond. The withdrawal defense's applicability to federal accomplice liability statute is debated. Recent dicta in Rosemond suggest that an accomplice may be able to withdraw and escape liability before the commission of a crime. The Supreme Court clarified that an accomplice must know of the offense beforehand to be held liable. Congress has not enacted a general civil aiding and abetting statute, leading to varying court interpretations on the matter. Courts do not presume that plaintiffs can sue aiders and abettors. Aiders and abettors are not held civilly liable for violations of various acts such as the Anti-Terrorism Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Stored Communications Act, or RICO."
