    "content": "The Act titled \"Ensuring Access to General Surgery Act of 2017\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. Congress finds a shortage of physicians and general surgeons in the United States by 2030, as projected by various studies and reports. Comprehensive research and data are needed to prepare for future workforce demands influenced by factors like health outcomes and population changes. Given the projected shortage of physicians and general surgeons in the United States by 2030, it is crucial to assess workforce needs considering utilization trends, population changes, and delivery system modifications. Additional efforts are required to evaluate the adequacy of the current general surgeon workforce, especially in rural and other areas facing surgical workforce shortages. A study will be conducted to assess the designation of general surgery shortage areas in the United States under the Public Health Service Act. The term 'general surgery shortage area' refers to areas in the US underserved by general surgeons. The Secretary will conduct a study on the adequacy of general surgeons in addressing the needs of underserved populations in urban, suburban, or rural areas. The Secretary will analyze potential methodologies for designating general surgery shortage areas, including the development of surgery service areas based on hospital and population data. Identification of surgeons in these areas will also be considered. The Secretary will analyze methodologies for identifying general surgery shortage areas based on zip code populations using Medicare data. This includes identifying general surgeons, establishing surgeon-to-population ratios, determining threshold ratios for optimal, adequate, shortage, and critical shortage levels, and submitting a report to Congress within one year. The Secretary will consult with stakeholders and publish data on general surgery services availability in different areas. Designation of general surgery shortage areas will be based on a methodology developed through regulation within 12 months. The Secretary may establish a methodology for designating general surgery shortage areas through rulemaking. This methodology will involve designating areas, publishing a list, and reviewing and revising the designations annually. Similar procedures will be followed for notifying relevant parties. The Secretary will establish a methodology for designating general surgery shortage areas through rulemaking, following procedures for notice, comment, dissemination of information, and reports to Congress. Consultation with stakeholders, including medical societies and organizations representing patients, will be conducted in the designation process."
