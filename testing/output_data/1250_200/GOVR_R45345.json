    "content": "Whistleblowing in the Intelligence Community (IC) involves reporting violations of law, mismanagement, waste of resources, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. Protections for IC whistleblowers only apply to lawful disclosures, not leaks to the media or foreign governments. The IC recognizes that whistleblowing can save money, promote ethics, and prompt corrective actions. Whistleblower protections in the Intelligence Community (IC) are in place to safeguard against leaking classified information to the media or foreign governments. These protections do not cover differences in policy or strategy unless there are concerns over legality. The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) has established procedures for IC whistleblowers to make protected disclosures, but there are debates over the transparency of internal processes to prevent reprisals. There are differing opinions on the transparency of the IC's internal processes and the adequacy of protections for IC contractors. Whistleblower protections in the IC have evolved over time, with the ICWPA of 1998 being the first legislation, followed by provisions in the Intelligence Authorization Acts of 2010 and 2014, as well as PPD-19 and ICD-120. These measures aim to address vulnerabilities of IC whistleblowers to reprisal actions. In Fiscal Year 2014, PPD-19 provisions were codified and ICD-120 established an implementation policy. 10 U.S.C. \u00a71034 provides whistleblower protections for Armed Forces members in the IC. DOD Directive 7050.06 outlines implementing guidance for Section 1034. In January 2018, Congress passed P.L. 115-118, amending the National Security Act of 1947 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to address gaps in protections for IC contractors. The ICWPA of 1998 assists IC whistleblowers excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. The Inspector General Act of 1978 established processes for IC government employees or contractors to report complaints to the Inspector General of their agency, ensuring protection of classified information. Complaints must be reported to the CIA Director or congressional intelligence committees within specific timeframes. If the IG fails to report accurately, employees or contractors can directly submit complaints to Congress after following certain procedures. The IC Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) allows employees and contractors to securely report complaints to Congress through the relevant IC agency IG. However, it lacks specific provisions for protecting whistleblowers from reprisal. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 included the first general provisions for whistleblower protection, establishing the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (OIGIC). Section 405(a)(1) of the IAA for FY2010 added a new Section 103H to the National Security Act of 1947, allowing lawful disclosures to the IGIC. The Inspector General is authorized to receive and investigate complaints or information regarding violations of laws, rules, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health and safety within the Director of National Intelligence's responsibilities. The identity of the employee making the complaint must be kept confidential unless unavoidable during the investigation or disclosed to the Department of Justice. No reprisal can be taken against the employee unless the complaint was knowingly false or made with willful disregard for the truth. The Inspector General can investigate complaints of violations within the intelligence community. Employees can report complaints to the Inspector General without fear of reprisal, as long as the complaint is not knowingly false. Contractors and federal employees are covered under this protection. Additional protections against reprisals for CIA employees were clarified in the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949. PPD-19, signed by President Obama in 2012, provides further protections for whistleblowers with access to classified information. PPD-19, signed by President Obama in 2012, provides protections for IC whistleblowers with access to classified information. It defines protected disclosures as reports of violations of laws or regulations, gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health or safety. The policy prohibits reprisals against employees who make lawful disclosures to specified officials. PPD-19 protects IC whistleblowers who report violations, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health or safety. It prohibits reprisals that could affect access to classified information or involve personnel actions against the employee. IC elements must certify a process for employees to seek review of personnel actions believed to be in reprisal. The Inspector General determines if a personnel action was in reprisal and makes recommendations for corrective action, which the agency head must consider. Agencies must certify a review process allowing employees to appeal actions. PPD-19 allows IC whistleblowers to request an external review by an IG panel if they have exhausted the agency review process. The panel's decision must be considered by the agency, but they are not required to accept the recommendation for corrective action. The IGIC must report annually to congressional intelligence committees on determinations and recommendations. Training on whistleblower protections is required for employees with access to classified information. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA codified provisions of PPD-19, providing statutory protections for IC whistleblowers. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA (P.L. 113-126) codified provisions of PPD-19, providing statutory protections for IC whistleblowers against personnel or security clearance actions in reprisal for protected disclosures. Section 601 protected whistleblowers from retaliation for lawful disclosures to specified entities, but did not mention protections for contractors. A lawful disclosure is defined as a violation of federal law, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health and safety. Section 602 of Title VI, part of the FY2014 IAA, protects government employee whistleblowers from retaliatory revocation of security clearance for making lawful disclosures. It also requires appeal policies for clearance decisions alleged to be reprisals. ICD-120, updated in 2016, provides IC guidance for PPD-19, including protections against reprisals for IC employees making protected disclosures. ICD-120 provisions include protections against reprisal for IC employees making protected disclosures, including contractors and members of the Armed Forces. It requires each IC element to have a review process for appeals related to security clearance decisions. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code also provides protections for members of the Armed Forces against retaliatory personnel actions. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code provides protections for members of the Armed Forces against retaliatory personnel actions for making protected communications, allowing communication with various entities and specifying prohibited actions in reprisal. The Armed Forces are protected when making communications, with the DOD able to mitigate hardship for members facing reprisal. The inspector general must provide updates on investigations to Congress, whistleblowers, the Secretary of Defense, and relevant services. The DOD Inspector General is required to set standards for investigating prohibited personnel actions and training for Inspector General staff. Existing whistleblower protection legislation for contractors in the intelligence community is inconsistent, with efforts in Congress to address the gap in coverage. On January 19, 2018, Congress passed P.L. 115-118, amending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to include Section 110 provisions for IC contractors' protections. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 2002 on October 24, 2017, to protect IC employees from retaliation for making protected disclosures. Another bill, S. 794, introduced by Senator McCaskill on March 18, 2015, aimed to extend whistleblower protections to contractor employees working with IC elements. On January 19, 2018, Congress passed P.L. 115-118, amending the National Security Act of 1947 to provide protections for IC contractor whistleblowers. Section 110 enables IC contractors to make lawful disclosures to the head of the contracting agency, appropriate inspector general, DNI, IGIC, and congressional intelligence committees. These protections are similar to those for IC employees under Title VI of the IAA for FY2014. Section 110 specifically protects IC contractors from retaliatory personnel actions. Section 110 of P.L. 115-118 provides protections for IC contractors who make lawful complaints against retaliatory personnel actions, including appointment, promotion/demotion, disciplinary actions, and more. These protections extend to complaints involving violations of Federal laws, gross mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health or safety. The protections also cover contractors of the FBI's IC element, similar to IC employees under Title 50, U.S. Code. Additionally, Section 110 amended Title 50, U.S. Code to include protections for IC contractors who make lawful whistleblower disclosures against retaliatory revocation of their security clearances. Section 3341(j) of Title 50, U.S. Code was amended to protect IC contractors making lawful whistleblower disclosures from retaliatory security clearance revocation. H.Amdt. 894, 113th Congress, redirected $2 million to fund the IC Whistleblower and Source Protection Directorate within OIGIC, enhancing investigative capabilities for fraud, waste, and abuse complaints. This measure addressed underfunded capabilities to enable responsive follow-up on whistleblower complaints."
