    "content": "SECTION 1. CREDIT FOR PURCHASE OF PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE BY FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYER. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to include a new section for the purchase of a principal residence by a first-time homebuyer. The tax code allows a credit of 10% of the purchase price of a first principal residence for first-time homebuyers, capped at $2,500. A first-time homebuyer is defined as an individual who has not owned a principal residence in the past 3 years, and all joint owners must also be first-time homebuyers. The tax code defines a first-time homebuyer as an individual who has not owned a principal residence in the past 3 years, and all joint owners must also be first-time homebuyers. The maximum credit for purchasing a residence is allocated among all individuals buying the property, and certain individuals are ineligible if specific conditions are met. Additionally, ownership interest does not include certain types of contracts of deed for eligible individuals. The eligibility period for the first-time homebuyer tax credit is defined as a 1-year period starting from the enactment of the section. A residence is considered purchased during this period if the buyer enters a binding contract and occupies the residence within 3 months after the eligibility period. The term 'purchase' refers to any property acquisition. The first-time homebuyer tax credit eligibility period starts from the enactment of the section and lasts for 1 year. A residence is considered purchased if the buyer enters a binding contract and occupies it within 3 months. The term 'purchase' refers to any property acquisition, with specific criteria outlined for the purchase price and principal residence. Unused credit can be carried over under certain conditions. The first-time homebuyer tax credit allows for the carryover of unused credit to the following taxable year, with a limit of 5 years for carryforward. There is also a provision for recapturing the credit if the property is disposed of within 36 months of acquisition. If a taxpayer disposes of their property within 36 months of acquiring it as their principal residence, the tax for that year is increased by the amount of the credit allowed for the property purchase. If the taxpayer buys a new principal residence within the specified period, the tax for that year is increased by the difference between the credit claimed for the new residence and the credit that could have been claimed for the first residence. The tax implications for disposing of a residence within 36 months of acquisition are outlined in the section. Exceptions include cases of death, casualty loss, or involuntary conversion of the property. Additionally, dispositions due to divorce or legal separation are also exempt from certain tax implications. The amendments in Section 23 allow first-time homebuyers to purchase a principal residence. These changes will apply to taxable years ending after the enactment of the Act."
