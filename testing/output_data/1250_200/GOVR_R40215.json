The Administration planned oversight for the stimulus legislation through a special board and the Recovery.gov website. The House and Senate included oversight provisions in the economic stimulus legislation, emphasizing accountability. Concerns were raised about agencies' capacity to spend funds efficiently and whether oversight bodies had enough resources. The House passed its version of the bill on January 28, 2009. The House and Senate passed versions of the stimulus legislation in early 2009, with negotiations ongoing. Challenges in crisis response include balancing speed and prudence, and reconciling values like transparency and efficiency. Long-term issues involve building capacity for federal agencies to respond better and anticipating preventable crises. The 9-11 Commission emphasized the importance of \"institutionalizing imagination\" to anticipate and prevent crises. The federal government operates with multiple oversight entities like Congress, OMB, and agencies to ensure accountability and monitoring of activities. Agencies follow organizational and procedural arrangements mandated by Congress to oversee their own activities. In overseeing activities, agencies follow organizational and procedural arrangements mandated by Congress. Tools like monitoring, analysis, and evaluation are used. Various perspectives on oversight objectives include compliance with laws, faithful implementation of congressional intent, avoidance of mismanagement, unbiased funding allocations, effectiveness, and efficiency of funded activities. The House and Senate versions of economic stimulus legislation include oversight provisions for funded activities, with a focus on minimizing waste and redundancy. Implementation agencies, nonfederal recipients of funds, OMB, oversight board, and IGs will play a role in oversight. References to \"the Act\" within each bill generally refer to specific divisions, not the entire bill."
