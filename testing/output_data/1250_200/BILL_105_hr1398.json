It also focuses on enhancing care for individuals with Parkinson's and their caregivers. This Act amends the Public Health Service Act to include provisions for Parkinson's disease research. The \"Parkinson's Research Act of 1997\" directs the Director of NIH to establish a program for Parkinson's disease research and training, coordinating with national research institutes. It includes holding research planning conferences every two years and awarding Core Center Grants for innovative research development. The Director of NIH awards Core Center Grants to establish Morris K. Udall Research Centers for Parkinson's disease research. Each center must conduct multidisciplinary research and training, meeting specific qualifications and conducting basic and clinical research. The Morris K. Udall Research Centers for Parkinson's disease research may conduct training programs, provide information to health professionals and the public, establish a nationwide data system, and create a Parkinson's Disease Information Clearinghouse. The Morris K. Udall Research Centers for Parkinson's disease aim to enhance knowledge and understanding of the disease, establish a national education program, provide stipends for scientists and health professionals in training programs, and receive support for a maximum of five years, extendable upon review. The Director of NIH will establish a grant program for Parkinson's disease research, providing grants for up to 5 years. $100,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1998, with additional funding for 1999 and 2000.
