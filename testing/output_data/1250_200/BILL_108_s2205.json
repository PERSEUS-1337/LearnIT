    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that Ukraine allows its citizens the right to emigrate with minimal taxes, complies with freedom of emigration requirements, and is committed to democratic institutions and human rights principles. Ukraine has made progress in meeting international commitments and standards in its recent Parliamentary elections, despite significant shortcomings in the implementation of election laws and allegations of interference and intimidation. As an OSCE participating state, Ukraine is committed to addressing issues related to national and religious minorities and has enacted legislation to protect against incitement to violence based on discrimination. Ukraine has made progress in combating ethnic and religious intolerance, including restitution of religious properties confiscated during the Soviet era. They have also received normal trade relations treatment since a bilateral trade agreement with the United States in 1992 and are working towards accession to international standards. Ukraine is progressing towards joining the World Trade Organization, addressing issues such as access for US agricultural products, intellectual property rights, tariff reductions, and labor rights. They have commitments to freedom of the press as an OSCE member, despite some infringements. Ukraine has positive relations with neighboring countries and aims for European integration, democracy, and prosperity. It has cooperated with the US in peacekeeping operations and fighting international terrorism. The President may determine that Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 should no longer apply to Ukraine and extend permanent normal trade relations treatment to the country's products. This would cease the application of Title IV to Ukraine. The Congress urges Ukraine to fulfill its commitments to the OSCE, including promoting free emigration, safeguarding religious liberty, combating discrimination and violence, and respecting media freedoms. They also support Ukraine in improving in various areas and making progress in enacting and enforcing protection measures. The Congress supports Ukraine in enacting and enforcing intellectual property rights, resolving trade disputes quickly, and monitoring human rights, rule of law, and media freedoms in the country. They also provide assistance to NGOs and human rights groups involved in democracy and rule of law activities in Ukraine. SEC. 4.
