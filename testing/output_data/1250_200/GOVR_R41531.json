    "content": "On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig experienced an uncontained release of hydrocarbons, causing explosions and fire, resulting in 11 fatalities. This incident led to the largest oil spill in U.S. waters, lasting approximately 84 days until responders gained control on July 15, 2010. The well ultimately released over 200 million gallons of crude oil. Satellite data showed decreasing daily quantities of oil on the ocean's surface after the spill. After the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, satellite analyses showed decreasing oil on the ocean's surface. On August 20, 2010, no oil was observed, leading to the discontinuation of satellite analyses on August 25, 2010. Despite this, oil was found in other areas, raising questions about its fate. Stakeholders are concerned about where the oil went, as its actual impact is still being assessed. Perceptions of the oil's fate may influence congressional actions and affect stakeholders. The fate of oil released into a marine environment is influenced by various factors, including its chemical composition, natural processes, location of the spill, and human intervention. Policymakers' perceptions of the oil's impact can affect congressional actions and stakeholder interests. The chemical composition of oil, including its various components, plays a critical role in how it reacts in the environment. Different compounds in crude oil evaporate at different rates, with some persisting for weeks to years. Spilled crude oil can form tar balls that are persistent and can be transported long distances. Lighter crude oil, like that released in the 2010 Gulf spill, may evaporate more readily in a marine environment, undergoing physical and chemical changes as it is transported and altered. The chemical composition of oil affects its behavior in the environment. Natural processes alter the oil's makeup through weathering, incorporating it into natural systems. The time for these changes varies, from minutes to years. Factors like water temperature and severe weather events influence the fate of spilled oil. The location of the oil release also plays a significant role in determining its fate. The fate of an oil spill can be influenced by various factors such as storm events, location of the release, and the chemical composition of the oil. In the Deepwater Horizon incident, the oil well blowout at a depth of 5,000 feet and the rapid discharge into the Gulf waters contributed to the unique circumstances that affected the oil's fate. In the 2010 Gulf spill, responders used mechanical removal, in situ burning, and chemical dispersants to clean up the oil. These methods have different effects on the oil's fate, with in situ burning transferring pollution risk to the air. EPA monitored particulate matter levels at the shoreline during the spill, finding them consistent with Gulf Coast summertime levels. In the 2010 Gulf spill, responders used mechanical removal, in situ burning, and chemical dispersants to clean up the oil. EPA monitored shoreline PM levels, consistent with Gulf Coast summertime levels. Dispersants break up oil slicks into small droplets, altering oil's transport and effects. Dispersant use aims to reduce surface oil reaching shore habitats but increases water column organisms' oil exposure. Federal responders authorized 1.8 million gallons of dispersants. Federal responders authorized the use of approximately 1.8 million gallons of dispersants in the Gulf during the Deepwater Horizon incident. Around 42% of the dispersant volume was applied at the wellhead, including a sub-surface application. Dispersant use ceased when the well was sealed on July 15. The impacts of chemically dispersed oil and dispersants remain unknown. On August 4, 2010, the National Incident Command released an oil spill budget estimate, garnering media attention and involving key Administration personnel. On November 23, 2010, the federal government released a peer-reviewed \"Technical Document\" explaining the oil budget estimates derived in August. The estimates categorized the oil into human intervention, natural processes, and other groups. The estimates are used for operational and response purposes, not to track the final fate of the spilled oil. The estimates from the November 2010 oil budget document categorized the oil into three groups: human intervention, natural processes, and other. Direct recovery from wellhead accounted for 17% of the total estimated release, with 820,000 barrels captured. Responders burned 260,000 barrels in situ, representing 5% of the total release. Skimmed oil was a rough calculation based on collected oil/water mixtures due to uncertainty in oil-water ratios. The oil budget estimate is 160,000 barrels (~6.7 million gallons)\u20143% of the total estimated release. Chemically dispersed: The budget estimates that 770,000 barrels (~32 million gallons) of oil were dispersed through the application of 1.8 million gallons of surface and sub-surface chemical dispersants\u201416% of the total estimated release. The estimate represents a near doubling compared to the August document, with the original estimate now considered conservative. The range of uncertainty for chemically dispersed oil is much larger than for other categories. The Technical Document highlights the challenges in estimating the effectiveness of chemically dispersed oil, with uncertainties dwarfing those of other categories. The budget estimates that 630,000 barrels of oil were naturally dispersed, defined as droplets smaller than 100 microns. The discussion mentions uncertainty factors for natural subsurface and surface dispersion, despite no uncertainty range provided for the \"naturally dispersed\" category. The Oil Budget Technical Document estimates that 1.2 million barrels of oil evaporated or dissolved, accounting for 24% of the total release. Dissolution played a significant role due to the nature and depth of the spill, with evaporation likely dominating the process. The \"other\" category accounts for 1.1 million barrels of oil, representing 22% of the total estimated release. This category includes oil on or just below the surface, weathered tar balls, and buried oil that may resurface over time. The estimates are based on formulas and assumptions, with uncertainties highlighted in the November Technical Document. The final mass balance calculation is subject to change with new information. The document highlights that the estimates are subject to change with new information, emphasizing uncertainty. There is a debate on the usefulness of releasing the estimates to the public due to the level of uncertainty and potential misinterpretation. The government's decision to share data/information is questioned, raising concerns about false perceptions of the oil's fate. This debate may be an issue for policymakers to consider in future oil spill responses. A substantial portion of oil, over 100 million gallons, remained in the Gulf as of the Oil Budget estimate. The OSAT report released in December 2010 provides clues about the remaining oil's physical and chemical state. Samples collected from May to October 2010 offer insights into the oil's fate in different Gulf areas. The oil spill resulted in contamination of hundreds of miles of Gulf state shorelines, with a decrease from 1,100 miles to 481 miles by October 2011. Despite a decline in oiled shoreline miles, a significant amount of oil remains unquantified on the beaches. The Deepwater Horizon incident resulted in contamination of hundreds of miles of Gulf state shorelines, with a decrease from 1,100 miles to 481 miles by October 2011. Despite this decline, a significant amount of oil remains unquantified on the beaches. An authoritative source is not aware of the volume of this oil, making it difficult to determine its contribution to the \"other\" category. Independent researchers initially reported potential underwater plumes of weathered oil near the spill source, which was met with skepticism. However, subsequent research confirmed the presence of undersea plumes linked to the incident, with peer-reviewed papers documenting further evidence. For example, a team from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution described a 35-kilometer-long plume southwest of the well site at a depth of 3,300 feet. The Joint Analysis Group (JAG), established by the Administration, includes officials from NOAA and EPA to coordinate subsea monitoring in the Gulf. The most recent JAG report (August 16, 2010) documented decreased dissolved oxygen levels, indicating subsurface dispersed oil. Water column sampling results showed elevated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) levels exceeding EPA benchmarks for aquatic life in June and July 2010. Some water samples exceeded EPA's PAH benchmarks for aquatic life, with concentrations up to ten times higher than the benchmark. Post-August 3, 2010, samples did not exceed the benchmarks. The OSAT report's water column sampling data provides limited insights on the oil's fate. The report lacks pre-spill data, necessary for understanding typical PAH levels in the Gulf and determining the percentage of samples consistent with BP well oil. Some oil from the BP well spill may have settled on the ocean floor, as indicated by sediment samples showing a layer of oil. However, ongoing sampling programs have not confirmed extensive oil presence on the Gulf bottom. The Technical Document discounts the claim of extensive oil on the Gulf bottom from the Deepwater Horizon spill. OSAT sampling suggests some oil may have settled in various sea floor locations, with elevated PAH levels in nearshore sediment samples in June-July 2010. No samples above benchmark levels were observed after August 3, 2010. All sediment samples were below pre-spill reference levels by October, indicating pre-impact average concentrations had been reached. Qualitative sampling also found oil in locations using snares and sorbent pads. The OSAT report identified oil in nearshore locations where tar mat formations had been previously observed by SCAT teams. A sampling data gap was noted in waters less than 10 feet deep, prompting further evaluation by a specific OSAT team. Offshore samples collected between August and October did not show PAH concentrations above benchmarks, with most samples at or below pre-spill levels. Deepwater sediment samples within three kilometers of the wellhead had the highest percentage exceeding PAH benchmarks, likely influenced by microbial organisms. Natural oil seeps in the Gulf may have also played a role in the fate of the oil. The Gulf of Mexico has natural oil seeps that release large volumes of oil each year. These seeps support a community of oil-eating bacteria, which can help the ecosystem adapt and thrive. Some studies suggest that microbial organisms played a role in the fate of the oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill, but there are conflicting opinions on the extent of their impact. A Woods Hole research team found that a subsurface oil plume persisted without biodegradation for months, while another study from Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory showed hydrocarbon-degrading populations in the same plume adapting rapidly to oil contamination. This suggests potential for intrinsic bioremediation of oil contaminants in the deep-sea. Another Woods Hole study in 2011 supported this idea for surface water activity, showing that oil-degrading communities could play a significant role in controlling the fate of hydrocarbons in the Gulf. The researchers found that microbial growth was hindered by limited phosphate in the offshore environment, but the microbes still digested the oil at a rapid rate. The fate of the remaining oil in the Gulf remains unknown due to various challenges and interpretations. Researchers are studying the complexity of the Gulf system, the resources needed for data collection, and the varied interpretations of results. Determining the fate of the oil will become more challenging over time, but efforts are ongoing to understand damages to natural resources, which may provide clues to the oil's fate."
