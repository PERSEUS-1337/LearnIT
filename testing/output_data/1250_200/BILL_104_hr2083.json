    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tax Reduction and Economic Growth Act of 1995\" and includes provisions for tax reduction in the event of low growth. The \"Low-Growth Report\" requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to notify the President and Congress if economic growth is below 1.5% and national unemployment is above 6.5% for specific testing periods. After notification of low economic growth and high unemployment, the President may declare temporary tax reductions for a specified calendar year to stimulate the economy. This declaration must be transmitted to Congress, and if approved, tax rates for the first income bracket will be reduced for taxable years in the specified calendar year. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for tax reductions up to 3 percent as declared by the President to stimulate the economy. Withholding tables will be adjusted to reflect the rate reduction for the remainder of the calendar year. If economic growth requirements are met, a temporary surtax may be implemented. Effective for taxable years beginning in the first subsequent calendar year where economic growth requirements are met, tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be increased by a certain percentage, except for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income below $50,000 and joint filers below $75,000. The tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be increased for taxable years beginning in the first subsequent calendar year if economic growth requirements are met. The rates shall not exceed the prior year's rates, and withholding tables will be adjusted accordingly. The President must determine and publish in the Federal Register that the economic growth requirements are satisfied for the calendar year. The President determines and publishes in the Federal Register that economic growth exceeds 4.5% and national unemployment is below 5.5% for the current and previous calendar years. The tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be increased by a percentage that balances out the decrease in receipts, without raising rates for lower-income individuals. The tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be increased by a percentage for taxpayers with Adjusted Gross Income below $75,000, based on economic requirements published in the Federal Register. SEC. 3. Treatment under pay-as-you-go procedures: Any changes in receipts from the Act will not affect the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
