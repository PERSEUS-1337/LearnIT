    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Media Campaign to Prevent Underage Drinking Act of 2001.\" It amends the Public Health Service Act to include a program for a national media campaign aimed at preventing underage drinking. The Act mandates a national media campaign to reduce underage drinking in the US, based on scientific research and in collaboration with the Surgeon General. The campaign aims to supplement existing efforts without replacing them. The Secretary will coordinate with various entities to reduce underage drinking in the US and use funds for media campaigns targeting specific geographic areas and minority groups. The Secretary will allocate funds for advertising in the national media campaign to reach minority groups effectively. The funds will be used for developing the campaign, purchasing media time and space, talent payments, production costs, testing, and evaluating advertising effectiveness. Funds under subsection (e) can be used for partnerships with community groups, government organizations, and entertainment industry collaborations to create underage-drinking prevention messages in various media formats. The curr_chunk discusses prohibitions on the use of funds available for media projects, public information, news media outreach, and corporate sponsorship. Prohibitions include not supplanting community-based efforts, pro bono public service time, partisan political purposes, or featuring certain officials in media campaigns without prior notice. The Secretary for Health must notify relevant committees in Congress and prohibit funding for advertising with company logos. A matching requirement for media purchases mandates non-Federal contributions to the campaign. Reports to Congress on the comprehensive strategy are required within six months of enactment. The Secretary must develop a comprehensive strategy on underage drinking within six months of enactment, including scientific basis, target audiences, goals, and evaluation plan. Annual reports to Congress on campaign activities and performance goals are also required. The Secretary must provide a progress report to Congress on the national media campaign's outcomes within one year of enactment. Funding for the campaign is authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2007, with a limitation of $1,000,000 for subsection (c)(1) activities."
