Recent congressional interest has focused on the regulations' impact on farms storing oil. Legislation from the 113th and 114th Congresses has altered the SPCC regulations' applicability for farms, with stakeholders citing financial burdens as a key concern. The EPA's SPCC regulations have financial implications for farms, with some arguing that compliance costs outweigh benefits. EPA has determined that preventing oil spills is more cost-effective than cleanup and penalties. A 2015 study found no need for exemptions for farms due to similar storage conditions as other facilities. Congressional legislation in the 114th Congress addresses SPCC regulations. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1970 directed the President to create oil spill prevention regulations, later amended in 1972 as the Clean Water Act. This provision remains in effect today, requiring regulations for preventing oil and hazardous substance discharges from vessels and facilities. President Nixon established the EPA in 1970, leading to subsequent changes in implementation authority. The Clean Water Act of 1972 mandated regulations to prevent oil spills from vessels and facilities. The EPA, Coast Guard, Department of Transportation, and Department of the Interior have jurisdiction over different types of facilities and pipelines. States can also impose their own requirements for oil discharge and removal activities. Many states have their own oil spill programs, beyond the scope of this report. EPA's SPCC regulations in 40 C.F.R. Part 112 require certain facilities to prepare and implement SPCC plans, with secondary containment for oil-storage units. Plans must be certified by a licensed professional engineer, unless self-certification conditions are met. Facilities with no reportable discharge history storing 10,000 gallons or less can self-certify, with a 20,000-gallon threshold for farms. About 99% of farms have storage capacity under 20,000 gallons and can self-certify their plans. EPA issued SPCC regulations in 1973, with changes in 2002. Compliance deadlines were extended, with farms given until May 10, 2013. Congress enacted P.L. 113-6, delaying enforcement at farms until September 22, 2013. Owners must maintain SPCC plans as required since 1974. The EPA requires owners of facilities, including farms, to maintain and implement SPCC plans in accordance with regulations since 1974. The SPCC plan applies to facilities that handle oil and could potentially discharge it into navigable waters. The definition of \"navigable waters\" has been a contentious issue, with recent revisions by the Army Corps of Engineers and EPA. The definition of oil includes petroleum-based and non-petroleum-based oils. EPA has clarified this definition since the inception of SPCC regulations in 1973. EPA's SPCC regulations apply to oils from animal and vegetable sources, as well as petroleum-based and non-petroleum-based oils. Facilities must meet capacity thresholds for aboveground and buried oil storage to be subject to the rule. Approximately 640,000 facilities are estimated to be subject to SPCC requirements, with oil and gas production facilities representing the largest percentage. The SPCC regulations apply to various industries, with oil and gas production facilities making up the largest percentage. Farms are also subject to these regulations, with recent attention on their applicability. Legislation was enacted in 2014 to modify the SPCC regulations for farms. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-121) modified SPCC regulations for farms, including changes to storage capacity thresholds and self-certification options. EPA was directed to assess the need for further adjustments based on risk assessment. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 modified SPCC regulations for farms, including changes to storage capacity thresholds. EPA was directed to assess the need for further adjustments based on risk assessment. WRRDA directed EPA to determine if the 6,000 gallon threshold should be decreased to 2,500 gallons due to the risk of oil discharge to water. EPA concluded that the threshold should be 2,500 gallons instead of 6,000 gallons. EPA was scheduled to release a proposed rule in August 2016, but as of the date of the report, no rule has been published. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 modified SPCC regulations for farms, including changes to storage capacity thresholds. WIIN provisions further modify SPCC regulations for farms, exempting smaller containers on separate parcels from SPCC regulations. The term \"separate parcels\" is key, but EPA's interpretation is uncertain. The term \"parcel\" is included in the definition of facility in SPCC regulations, but it is not defined. EPA modified the definition of facility in 2008 to include various structures and equipment used in oil-related activities. The boundaries of a facility depend on ownership, operation, and types of activities on the site. Contiguous or non-contiguous properties under the same ownership may be considered separate facilities. EPA's interpretation of \"separate parcels\" is uncertain. The SPCC regulations do not delegate enforcement to states, and EPA regional offices are responsible for enforcement. A 2012 EPA report highlighted a lack of awareness of compliance status among regulated facilities, with 55% found to be non-compliant. This poses an enforcement challenge for policymakers. Approximately 55% of facilities were found to be out of compliance with SPCC requirements from August 2010 to June 2011. No recent report on enforcement activities is available."
