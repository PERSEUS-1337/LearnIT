    "content": "Title VI of the Higher Education Act authorizes grants to institutions for enhancing foreign language and area studies. The program has a long history dating back to the National Defense Education Act of 1958, supporting courses in less commonly taught languages and regions. Federal support for FLAS programs reflects priorities in diplomacy, national security, and trade competitiveness. Interest in these programs has increased due to concerns about terrorism from foreign regions. The funding for Title VI and other federal programs supporting FLAS has increased recently due to concerns about terrorism from foreign regions not commonly included in American postsecondary curricula. The report provides an overview of Title VI programs and reauthorization issues. The appropriation for Title VI remained at $93.1 million in FY2007 and $95.6 million in FY2008. The U.S. Department of Education has discretion in allocating funds among specific activities under Title VI, with most grants made on a multi-year basis. Title VI activities are organized under Parts A, B, and C with multi-year grants. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 authorized funding through 2005. The last specific authorization was in FY1999 for $80 million for Part A, $18 million for Part B, and $10 million for Part C. Most funds are used for National Language and Area Centers (NLACs) and FLAS Fellowships. Recipients of Title VI grants also receive FLAS Fellowships for graduate students. These programs are the core activities supported under Title VI, with other smaller-scale supplementary activities serving specific goals. Funds are allocated competitively, with an emphasis on excellence and equitable distribution. The increased funding for Title VI comes with provisions specifying activities and regions for aid recipients to specialize in. The FY2002 Department of Education Appropriations Act and FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution retained provisions directing funds towards specific world regions and languages. The guidance aims to sustain investments in training experts with foreign language proficiency in targeted areas like Central and South Asia, the Middle East, and Russia. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-447) provides funding for cross-cultural skills in strategic world areas like Central and South Asia, the Middle East, Russia, and the former Soviet Union. Funds are allocated for foreign language capacity building and international expertise in regions important to national security interests. The act also earmarks funds for program evaluation and an independent review of Title VI programs. The International Research and Studies program funds are used for assessing the effects of HEA Title VI programs, including program graduates. The EELIAS project aims to evaluate and assess HEA Title VI programs, develop performance indicators, an Internet-based data reporting system, and evaluate the need for advanced foreign language and international studies at IHEs. The EELIAS project aims to evaluate HEA Title VI programs over a five-year period. A 2000 report highlighted the critical importance of Title VI support in maintaining the nation's capacity in less commonly taught languages. IHEs receiving Title VI NLAC grants enroll a significant percentage of graduate students in these languages. The Higher Education Act Title VI grants support the development of textbooks for Less Commonly Taught Languages. There is a need for advanced knowledge of languages and cultures of nations of current concern to address increasing global interactions and national security issues. The reauthorization of the Higher Education Act during the 110th Congress may involve debates on these issues. Support for instruction in critical foreign languages and cultures is crucial due to unpredictable future concerns. The federal government operates language schools to meet immediate needs, raising questions on whether support should be focused on colleges, government institutions, or both. The federal government operates language schools like the Defense Language Institute and the Foreign Service Institute to meet immediate foreign language requirements. Title VI of the HEA provides institutional aid and fellowships for specific subject areas, unlike other programs that focus on student aid based on financial need. This targeted approach requires specific justification. The continuation of subject area-specific aid under Title VI is crucial as advanced study of foreign languages and regions is vital for national security, defense, and economic competitiveness. This aid supports research and instructional programs in critical foreign language and area studies, benefiting federal employees and the broader public by increasing understanding of foreign nations and cultures. The research and development of foreign language instruction in higher education institutions (IHEs) is more likely to occur in IHEs than in federal institutions. The quality of Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) programs depends on linkages between American and foreign educational institutions, which can be easier to establish in colleges and universities. Other federal agencies also provide support for specific subject areas on a larger scale than HEA Title VI, such as health care education and training by the National Institutes of Health. The curr_chunk discusses the potential need for targeted federal support in critical foreign language and area studies education at higher education institutions. It suggests that federal subsidies could be limited to start-up costs rather than ongoing expenses, and emphasizes the importance of utilizing language skills of recent immigrants. The curr_chunk highlights the challenges faced by individual institutions in offering instruction in rare languages like Pashto or Farsi. Proponents argue for federal support under programs like Title VI to ensure adequate funding for critical language studies. Without such support, ongoing funding may be insufficient to meet national needs. The report focuses on Title VI of the HEA as the largest federal support for FLAS in U.S. colleges. It questions the coordination of Title VI with other programs and suggests consolidation for efficiency. The primary federal programs related to Title VI include the Defense Language Institute and the Foreign Service Institute School for Language Studies. The Fulbright-Hays Act authorizes international exchange activities administered by the Department of State, including exchanges of graduate students and scholars in various fields. The programs relevant to HEA Title VI are administered by ED's Office of Postsecondary Education, supporting foreign travel-related activities by American citizens. The Fulbright-Hays programs administered by ED's Office of Postsecondary Education support foreign travel activities for American graduate students and professors to improve FLAS instruction in U.S. colleges. The programs are smaller in scale compared to HEA Title VI, with a total appropriation of $12.9 million in FY2003. The NSEP under the David L. Boren National Security Education Act provides scholarships, grants, and fellowships for American undergraduate and graduate students for international education and foreign language studies. The NSEP under the David L. Boren National Security Education Act provides scholarships, grants, and fellowships for American undergraduate and graduate students for international education and foreign language studies. The program aims to support programs in critical foreign language and area studies, with a focus on devoting one-third of funding to three main activities. Recipients are required to seek employment in national security positions or in higher education related to their area of study. Institutional grants have been used to establish instructional and exchange programs involving less commonly taught languages and nations/regions at various U.S. institutions. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) supports exchange programs involving less commonly taught languages and nations/regions at U.S. institutions. It aims to increase disadvantaged/minority student participation in international education and integrate foreign language studies with professional education. A revised strategy includes a Flagship Language Initiative focusing on critical foreign languages, with grants initiated in 2002 under P.L. 107-306. NSEP complements HEA Title VI programs with unique elements like a service requirement and travel grants for undergraduate students. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) supports exchange programs involving less commonly taught languages and nations/regions at U.S. institutions. It includes a service requirement and travel grants for undergraduate students. Administered by the Department of Defense's National Defense University, NSEP determines critical areas for national security. Grants are processed through non-governmental organizations like the Institute of International Education (IIE) for undergraduates and the Academy for Educational Development (AED) for graduate fellowships. NSEP grants began in the academic year 1994-1995. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) provides grants for exchange programs focusing on less commonly taught languages and regions at U.S. institutions. It has a service requirement and supports international travel for undergraduate students. Administered by the Department of Defense, NSEP determines critical national security areas. The program's funding was initially at $150 million but was reduced to $75 million. NSEP is smaller in scale compared to HEA Title VI and is focused on meeting national security-related skill needs. It is financed through a trust fund and is authorized by the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000. The Gilman program, authorized by the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000, provides scholarships of up to $5,000 for U.S. citizen undergraduate students. Recipients must be Pell Grant recipients from low-income families and preference is given to those who have not studied abroad before. The program aims to offer study abroad opportunities to students who may not otherwise be able to participate. The Gilman program offers study abroad opportunities to students who may not otherwise be able to participate. In the 2002-2003 academic year, 179 students received Gilman Scholarships administered by the Department of State through the Institute of International Education. The Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) administers programs to foster innovative approaches in U.S. postsecondary education, including support for international education programs. The U.S. Department of State offers various programs for international education cooperation, including grants for consortia between U.S. and foreign institutions. Funding levels for these programs in FY2002 range from $1.5 million to $2.25 million. There is a question of whether these programs should be consolidated under a coordinated national strategy for efficiency. The importance of coordination among grant programs like Fulbright-Hays, FIPSE, and NSEP is discussed. While these programs are already potentially coordinated under ED's Office of Postsecondary Education Programs, further consolidation or placement under a single coordinating board could enhance efficiency. The NSEP's emphasis on national security needs and service requirements for aid recipients distinguish it from other programs, suggesting that coordination may be more consistent with its purposes than consolidation with Title VI. The NSEP, with its national security focus and service requirements, may benefit from coordination with other grant programs like Fulbright-Hays and FIPSE. The possibility of transferring the Gilman International Scholarship Program to the Department of Education and incorporating it under the Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign Language Programs of HEA Title VI is also considered. Additionally, establishing a multi-agency board or foundation for coordination may be proposed. Proposals may include establishing a multi-agency board or federal entity to coordinate federal programs for foreign language and international studies. This entity could oversee programs like Fulbright-Hays and the K-12 Foreign Language Assistance Program. Increased coordination between institutions funded by HEA Title VI and federal agencies offering language instruction is also suggested, potentially aligning fellowship targeting with government language needs and coordinating instructional programs. Currently, HEA Title VI grants are dispersed across various languages and regions, including critical areas like the Middle East and South Asia. While the importance of languages may change over time, there should be a stable group of languages supported by federal funding. It is important to identify a stable group of languages or regions for Title VI funding, rather than shifting funds based on newly critical areas. The decision-making process for targeting funds could involve ED, an interagency advisory body, a new entity for federal FLAS programs, or Congress. Federal support for FLAS studies under Title VI grants attracts additional funds from various sources, enhancing the program's impact. Grants from the HEA Title VI program attract additional funds from various sources, but the adequacy of the program to meet national needs is questioned. Opponents argue against increased targeting of grants towards specific languages and regions, suggesting reliance on IHEs to propose new programs instead. The level of national needs is difficult to quantify precisely, with suggestions to support a comprehensive range of languages and regions rather than directing grants through a central body. The level of national needs for language skills is challenging to quantify precisely. Efforts to assess these needs include annual surveys and reports like the NSEP analysis and a recent study by the General Accounting Office. The GAO report highlighted the increasing demand for federal employees with foreign language skills due to changing security environments and the globalization of the U.S. economy. The increasing globalization of the U.S. economy has led to a greater need for federal employees with foreign language skills. Four agencies have reported shortages of translators, interpreters, diplomats, and intelligence specialists with critical language skills, impacting agency operations and hindering various U.S. efforts."
