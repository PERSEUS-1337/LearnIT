    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Opportunities for Fairness in Farming Act of 2017\". The generic programs known as \"checkoff programs\" are intended to increase demand for agricultural commodities and benefit producers. However, there have been instances of funds being used to influence policy, leading to conflicts of interest and harming some producers. Strict separation between Boards and policy entities is necessary to prevent misuse of funds. Prohibiting conflicts of interest and anticompetitive conduct, ensuring transparency in checkoff program funds, and promoting agricultural commodities are essential for the proper operation of checkoff programs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"Board\" as an entity for checkoff programs, and \"checkoff program\" as a promotional program for agricultural commodities without specific producers or brands, including programs under various agricultural acts. The Nutrition Education Act and various other agricultural acts establish promotional programs for different agricultural commodities. The Nutrition Education Act and other agricultural acts establish promotional programs for various agricultural commodities such as soybeans, fluid milk, fresh cut flowers, fresh cut greens, sheep, canola, rapeseed, kiwifruit, and popcorn. The Consumer Information Act includes provisions for promoting agricultural commodities like popcorn and avocados. It defines conflict of interest and specifies the role of the Secretary of Agriculture. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS OF CHECKOFF PROGRAMS. Prohibitions include not entering contracts with parties influencing government policies related to agriculture, avoiding conflicts of interest, and prohibiting anticompetitive activities or unfair practices. Boards must also refrain from disparaging other agricultural commodities. Boards can enter contracts with approval from the Secretary. The Board can enter contracts and agreements for promotion, research, or other activities with approval from the Secretary. Contracts must include accurate record-keeping of funds and disbursements, which must be published for public inspection. The Board can enter contracts for promotion, research, or other activities with approval from the Secretary. Required disclosures for disbursements include amount, purpose, recipient, and other parties involved. Periodic audits by the Inspector General of USDA are mandated to ensure compliance with the section. The Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture conducts audits to determine compliance of checkoff programs. Reports are submitted to Congress and the Comptroller General upon completion of each audit. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct an audit every 3-5 years to assess compliance and integrity of checkoff programs, with a report including recommendations for improvement. The Comptroller General of the United States will consider inspector general reports when making recommendations to strengthen checkoff programs and improve related Federal legislation. SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected."
