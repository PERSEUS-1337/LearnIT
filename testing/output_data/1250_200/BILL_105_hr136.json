Marjory Stoneman Douglas, known for defining the Everglades ecosystem through her book \"The Everglades: River of Grass,\" dedicated her life to its defense against threats like drainage and development. She was the last surviving member of the original group that established Everglades National Park and was awarded the Medal of Freedom in 1994. Ernest F. Coe was also a key figure in the creation of the park. Ernest F. Coe, a leader in the creation of Everglades National Park, was awarded the Medal of Freedom in 1994 for his vision to protect south Florida's wildlife and habitats. His efforts led to the authorization of the park by Congress in 1934, and he finally realized his dream in 1947 through his selfless devotion and commitment. The purpose of this section is to commemorate the vision and enduring contributions of Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Ernest F. Coe in protecting the Everglades and establishing Everglades National Park. The Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness is redesignated to honor Mrs. Douglas's leadership in protecting the Everglades. The Secretary of the Interior will inform the public of the redesignation of the Everglades Wilderness to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness through various means. Any references to the Everglades Wilderness in official documents will now refer to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness. Additionally, the Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center will be designated after the completion of construction at Everglades National Park. The main visitor center facility at Everglades National Park will be named `The Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center' to honor Mr. Coe's contributions. Additionally, the visitor center will be renamed `Marjory Stoneman Douglas Visitor Center'. A technical correction will also be made to replace \"personnally-owned\" with \"personally-owned\"."
