    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Public School Redefinition Act of 1993\". The Congress emphasizes the importance of improving educational services for all citizens, especially disadvantaged individuals, to enhance national and economic security. Fundamental reform is necessary to unleash the potential of teachers, students, parents, and communities. Market competition and choice can drive reform, but more educational options are needed for all students, including those who are disadvantaged. Local educational agencies' monopoly on creating new public schools has limited choices for parents and students. Public education should focus on outcomes that serve the public interest. Public education should be defined by outcomes that protect and promote the public interest, not by ownership or control of facilities by local agencies. The purpose of this Act is to encourage the establishment of new and more effective public schools by providing federal assistance and flexibility to states, teachers, parents, and communities. It also aims to provide criteria for establishing such schools. The Act defines terms like \"eligible partnership\" as a partnership between a sponsor and a charter public school, \"local educational agency\" as defined in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and \"charter public school\" as a nonsectarian school providing instruction from kindergarten to twelfth grade without charging tuition and complying with certain civil rights laws. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms like \"Secretary,\" \"sponsor,\" and \"State educational agency\" in relation to charter public schools. It also outlines requirements for charter schools such as admitting students through a lottery, financial audits, health and safety compliance, and participation in eligible partnerships. The curr_chunk defines \"State educational agency\" as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The curr_chunk states \"Program Authority\" in relation to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to State educational agencies for charter public school programs. Grants can also be awarded to charter public schools in states that choose not to participate. Grant funds are to be used for planning and implementing charter public schools. Each charter public school receiving a grant must use the funds to plan and implement a school in accordance with the Act. State educational agencies can reserve up to 5% of grant funds for administrative expenses. Charter public schools can receive grants for a maximum of 3 years and must provide matching funds of 10% in the first year and 25% in the second and third years. The Secretary will ensure geographic dispersion of grants. Grant funds awarded under this Act can be used for planning, equipment purchases, and minor renovation to meet health and safety requirements. Construction, major renovation, or repair of facilities is prohibited. The Secretary will ensure grants benefit students in urban and rural areas. SEC. 6. APPLICATION. Each State educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under this Act, detailing the objectives of their charter public school program, steps taken to inform stakeholders, and assurances of obtaining waivers for applicable statutes and regulations. The curr_chunk outlines requirements for establishing charter public schools, including outcomes agreements, meeting charter school definitions, student achievement outcomes, progress measurement, and involvement of teachers and parents. Each charter public school seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary with required information and assurances, including involvement of teachers, parents, and community members in planning and implementation. SEC. 7. OUTCOMES AGREEMENT.\n\nCharter public schools must enter into an outcomes agreement with the sponsor to receive a grant under this Act. The agreement includes setting forth outcomes to achieve and providing necessary information and assurances.\n\nSEC. 8. CONTINUATION OF FUNDING.\n\nCharter public schools receiving a grant under this Act are eligible for Federal, State, and local education funding as a local educational agency.\n\nSEC. 9. TERMINATION. SEC. 9. TERMINATION. The Secretary or State educational agency will stop grant payments if a charter public school is not making acceptable progress. SEC. 10. REPORTS. Charter public schools must report annually on progress to the State agency or Secretary. SEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the Act includes $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1995, and necessary sums for the following three fiscal years."
